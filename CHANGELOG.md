# Change Log

## TBD
  - All:
    - expose more formats via adapter-specific feature
    - fix creation of depth+stencil views
  - Metal:
    - fix usage of work group memory

## v0.10 (2021-08-18)
  - Infrastructure:
    - `gfx-hal` is replaced by the in-house graphics abstraction `wgpu-hal`. Backends: Vulkan, Metal, D3D-12, and OpenGL ES-3.
    - examples are tested automatically for image snapshots.
  - API:
    - `cross` feature is removed entirely. Only Rust code from now on.
    - processing SPIR-V inputs for later translation now requires `spirv` compile feature enabled
    - new `Features::SPIRV_SHADER_PASSTHROUGH` run-time feature allows providing pass-through SPIR-V (orthogonal to the compile feature)
    - several bitflag names are renamed to plural: `TextureUsage`, `BufferUsage`, `ColorWrite`.
    - the `SwapChain` is merged into `Surface`. Returned frames are `Texture` instead of `TextureView`.
    - renamed `TextureUsage` bits: `SAMPLED` -> `TEXTURE_BINDING`, `STORAGE` -> `STORAGE_BINDING`.
    - renamed `InputStepMode` to `VertexStepMode`.
    - readable storage textures are no longer a part of the base API. Only exposed via format-specific features, non-portably.
    - implemented `Rgb9e5Ufloat` format.
    - added limits for binding sizes, vertex data, per-stage bindings, and others.
    - reworked downlevel flags, added downlevel limits.
    - `resolver = "2"` is now required in top-level cargo manifests
  - Fixed:
    - `Device::create_query_set` would return an error when creating exactly `QUERY_SET_MAX_QUERIES` (8192) queries. Now it only returns an error when trying to create *more* than `QUERY_SET_MAX_QUERIES` queries.

## wgpu-core-0.9.2
  - fix `Features::TEXTURE_SPECIFIC_FORMAT_FEATURES` not being supported for rendertargets

## wgpu-core-0.9.1 (2021-07-13)
  - fix buffer inits delayed by a frame

  - fix pipeline statistics stride
  - fix the check for maximum query count

## v0.9 (2021-06-18)
  - Updated:
    - naga to `v0.5`.
  - Added:
    - `Features::VERTEX_WRITABLE_STORAGE`.
    - `Features::CLEAR_COMMANDS` which allows you to use `cmd_buf.clear_texture` and `cmd_buf.clear_buffer`.

    - Updated default storage buffer/image limit to `8` from `4`.
  - Fixed:
    - `Buffer::get_mapped_range` can now have a range of zero.
    - Fixed output spirv requiring the "kernal" capability.
    - Fixed segfault due to improper drop order.
    - Fixed incorrect dynamic stencil reference for Replace ops.
    - Fixed tracking of temporary resources.
    - Stopped unconditionally adding cubemap flags when the backend doesn't support cubemaps.
  - Validation:
    - Ensure that if resources are viewed from the vertex stage, they are read only unless `Features::VERTEX_WRITABLE_STORAGE` is true.
    - Ensure storage class (i.e. storage vs uniform) is consistent between the shader and the pipeline layout.
    - Error when a color texture is used as a depth/stencil texture.
    - Check that pipeline output formats are logical
    - Added shader label to log messages if validation fails.
  - Tracing:
    - Make renderpasses show up in the trace before they are run.
  - Docs: 
    - Fix typo in `PowerPreference::LowPower` description.
  - Player:
    - Automatically start and stop RenderDoc captures.
  - Examples:
    - Handle winit's unconditional exception.
  - Internal: 
    - Merged wgpu-rs and wgpu back into a single repository.
    - The tracker was split into two different stateful/stateless trackers to reduce overhead.
    - Added code coverage testing
    - CI can now test on lavapipe
    - Add missing extern "C" in wgpu-core on `wgpu_render_pass_execute_bundles`
    - Fix incorrect function name `wgpu_render_pass_bundle_indexed_indirect` to `wgpu_render_bundle_draw_indexed_indirect`.
