## Unreleased

### Major changes

#### TextureFormat info API

The `describe` fn was removed in favor of separate functions: `block_dimensions`, `is_compressed`, `is_srgb`, `required_features`, `guaranteed_format_features`, `sample_type` and `block_size`.

```diff
- let block_dimensions = format.describe().block_dimensions;
+ let block_dimensions = format.block_dimensions();
- let is_compressed = format.describe().is_compressed();
+ let is_compressed = format.is_compressed();
- let is_srgb = format.describe().srgb;
+ let is_srgb = format.is_srgb();
- let required_features = format.describe().required_features;
+ let required_features = format.required_features();
- let guaranteed_format_features = format.describe().guaranteed_format_features;
+ let guaranteed_format_features = format.guaranteed_format_features();
```

Additionally `sample_type` and `block_size` now take an optional `TextureAspect` and return `Option`s.

```diff
- let sample_type = format.describe().sample_type;
+ let sample_type = format.sample_type(None).expect("combined depth-stencil format requires specifying a TextureAspect");
- let block_size = format.describe().block_size;
+ let block_size = format.block_size(None).expect("combined depth-stencil format requires specifying a TextureAspect");
```

By @teoxoy in [#3436](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3436)

#### BufferUsages::QUERY_RESOLVE

Buffers used as the `destination` argument of `CommandEncoder::resolve_query_set` now have to contain the `QUERY_RESOLVE` usage instead of the `COPY_DST` usage.

```diff
  let destination = device.create_buffer(&wgpu::BufferDescriptor {
      // ...
-     usage: wgpu::BufferUsages::COPY_DST | wgpu::BufferUsages::MAP_READ,
+     usage: wgpu::BufferUsages::QUERY_RESOLVE | wgpu::BufferUsages::MAP_READ,
      mapped_at_creation: false,
  });
  command_encoder.resolve_query_set(&query_set, query_range, &destination, destination_offset);
```

By @JolifantoBambla in [#3489](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3489)

#### Renamed features

The following `Features` have been renamed.

- `SHADER_FLOAT16` -> `SHADER_F16`
- `SHADER_FLOAT64` -> `SHADER_F64`
- `SHADER_INT16` -> `SHADER_I16`
- `TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_ASTC_LDR` -> `TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_ASTC`
- `WRITE_TIMESTAMP_INSIDE_PASSES` -> `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES`

By @teoxoy in [#3534](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3534)

#### Anisotropic Filtering

Anisotropic filtering has been brought in line with the spec. The anisotropic clamp is now a u16 (was a `Option<u8>`) which must be at least 1.

If the anisotropy clamp is not 1, all the filters in a sampler must be `Linear`.

```diff
SamplerDescriptor {
-    anisotropic_clamp: None,
+    anisotropic_clamp: 1,
}
```

By @cwfitzgerald in [#3610](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3610).

## wgpu-0.15.0 (2023-01-25)

### Major Changes


#### WGSL Top-Level `let` is now `const`

All top level constants are now declared with `const`, catching up with the wgsl spec.

`let` is no longer allowed at the global scope, only within functions.

```diff
-let SOME_CONSTANT = 12.0;
+const SOME_CONSTANT = 12.0;
```

See https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v011-2023-01-25 for smaller shader improvements.

#### Surface Capabilities API

The various surface capability functions were combined into a single call that gives you all the capabilities.

```diff
- let formats = surface.get_supported_formats(&adapter);
- let present_modes = surface.get_supported_present_modes(&adapter);
- let alpha_modes = surface.get_supported_alpha_modes(&adapter);
+ let caps = surface.get_capabilities(&adapter);
+ let formats = caps.formats;
+ let present_modes = caps.present_modes;
+ let alpha_modes = caps.alpha_modes;
```

Additionally `Surface::get_default_config` now returns an Option and returns None if the surface isn't supported by the adapter.

```diff
- let config = surface.get_default_config(&adapter);
+ let config = surface.get_default_config(&adapter).expect("Surface unsupported by adapter");
```

#### Fallible surface creation

`Instance::create_surface()` now returns `Result<Surface, CreateSurfaceError>` instead of `Surface`. This allows an error to be returned if the given window is a HTML canvas and obtaining a WebGPU or WebGL 2 context fails. (No other platforms currently report any errors through this path.) By @kpreid in [#3052](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3052/)

#### `Queue::copy_external_image_to_texture` on WebAssembly

A new api, `Queue::copy_external_image_to_texture`, allows you to create wgpu textures from various web image primitives. Specificically from `HtmlVideoElement`, `HtmlCanvasElement`, `OffscreenCanvas`, and `ImageBitmap`. This provides multiple low-copy ways of interacting with the browser. WebGL is also supported, though WebGL has some additional restrictions, represented by the `UNRESTRICTED_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_COPIES` downlevel flag. By @cwfitzgerald in [#3288](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3288)

#### Instance creation now takes `InstanceDescriptor` instead of `Backends`

`Instance::new()` and `hub::Global::new()` now take an `InstanceDescriptor` struct which cointains both the existing `Backends` selection as well as a new `Dx12Compiler` field for selecting which Dx12 shader compiler to use.

```diff
- let instance = Instance::new(wgpu::Backends::all());
+ let instance = Instance::new(wgpu::InstanceDescriptor {
+     backends: wgpu::Backends::all(),
+     dx12_shader_compiler: wgpu::Dx12Compiler::Fxc,
+ });
```

`Instance` now also also implements `Default`, which uses `wgpu::Backends::all()` and `wgpu::Dx12Compiler::Fxc` for `InstanceDescriptor`

```diff
- let instance = Instance::new(wgpu::InstanceDescriptor {
-     backends: wgpu::Backends::all(),
-     dx12_shader_compiler: wgpu::Dx12Compiler::Fxc,
- });
+ let instance = Instance::default();
```

By @Elabajaba in [#3356](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3356)

#### Texture Format Reinterpretation

The new `view_formats` field in the `TextureDescriptor` is used to specify a list of formats the texture can be re-interpreted to in a texture view. Currently only changing srgb-ness is allowed (ex. `Rgba8Unorm` <=> `Rgba8UnormSrgb`).

```diff
let texture = device.create_texture(&wgpu::TextureDescriptor {
  // ...
  format: TextureFormat::Rgba8UnormSrgb,
+ view_formats: &[TextureFormat::Rgba8Unorm],
});
```

```diff
let config = wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration {
  // ...
  format: TextureFormat::Rgba8Unorm,
+ view_formats: vec![wgpu::TextureFormat::Rgba8UnormSrgb],
};
surface.configure(&device, &config);
```

#### MSAA x2 and x8 Support

Via the `TEXTURE_ADAPTER_SPECIFIC_FORMAT_FEATURES` feature, MSAA x2 and x8 are now supported on textures. To query for x2 or x8 support, enable the feature and look at the texture format flags for the texture format of your choice.

By @39ali in [3140](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3140)

#### DXC Shader Compiler Support for DX12

You can now choose to use the DXC compiler for DX12 instead of FXC. The DXC compiler is faster, less buggy, and allows for new features compared to the old, unmaintained FXC compiler.

You can choose which compiler to use at `Instance` creation using the `dx12_shader_compiler` field in the `InstanceDescriptor` struct. Note that DXC requires both `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll`, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases. Both .dlls need to be shipped with your application when targeting DX12 and using the `DXC` compiler. If the .dlls can't be loaded, then it will fall back to the FXC compiler. By @39ali and @Elabajaba in [#3356](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3356)

#### Suballocate DX12 buffers and textures

The DX12 backend can now suballocate buffers and textures from larger chunks of memory, which can give a significant increase in performance (in testing a 100x improvement has been seen in a simple scene with 200 `write_buffer` calls per frame, and a 1.4x improvement in [Bistro using Bevy](https://github.com/vleue/bevy_bistro_playground)).

Previously `wgpu-hal`'s DX12 backend created a new heap on the GPU every time you called `write_buffer` (by calling `CreateCommittedResource`), whereas now it uses [`gpu_allocator`](https://crates.io/crates/gpu-allocator) to manage GPU memory (and calls `CreatePlacedResource` with a suballocated heap). By @Elabajaba in [#3163](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3163)

#### Backend selection by features in wgpu-core

Whereas `wgpu-core` used to automatically select backends to enable
based on the target OS and architecture, it now has separate features
to enable each backend:

- "metal", for the Metal API on macOS and iOS
- "vulkan", for the Vulkan API (Linux, some Android, and occasionally Windows)
- "dx12", for Microsoft's Direct3D 12 API
- "gles", OpenGL ES, available on many systems
- "dx11", for Microsoft's Direct3D 11 API

None are enabled by default, but the `wgpu` crate automatically
selects these features based on the target operating system and
architecture, using the same rules that `wgpu-core` used to, so users
of `wgpu` should be unaffected by this change. However, other crates
using `wgpu-core` directly will need to copy `wgpu`'s logic or write
their own. See the `[target]` section of `wgpu/Cargo.toml` for
details.

Similarly, `wgpu-core` now has `emscripten` and `renderdoc` features
that `wgpu` enables on appropriate platforms.

In previous releases, the `wgpu-core` crate decided which backends to
support. However, this left `wgpu-core`'s users with no way to
override those choices. (Firefox doesn't want the GLES back end, for
example.) There doesn't seem to be any way to have a crate select
backends based on target OS and architecture that users of that crate
can still override. Default features can't be selected based on the
target, for example. That implies that we should do the selection as
late in the dependency DAG as feasible. Having `wgpu` (and
`wgpu-core`'s other dependents) choose backends seems like the best
option.

By @jimblandy in [#3254](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3254).

## wgpu-0.14.0 (2022-10-05)

### Major Changes

#### @invariant Warning

When using CompareFunction::Equal or CompareFunction::NotEqual on a pipeline, there is now a warning logged if the vertex
shader does not have a @invariant tag on it. On some machines, rendering the same triangles multiple times without an
@invariant tag will result in slightly different depths for every pixel. Because the \*Equal functions rely on depth being
the same every time it is rendered, we now warn if it is missing.

```diff
-@vertex
-fn vert_main(v_in: VertexInput) -> @builtin(position) vec4<f32> {...}
+@vertex
+fn vert_main(v_in: VertexInput) -> @builtin(position) @invariant vec4<f32> {...}
```

#### Surface Alpha and PresentModes

Surface supports `alpha_mode` now. When alpha_mode is equal to `PreMultiplied` or `PostMultiplied`,
the alpha channel of framebuffer is respected in the compositing process, but which mode is available depends on
the different API and `Device`. If don't care about alpha_mode, you can set it to `Auto`.

```diff
SurfaceConfiguration {
// ...
+ alpha_mode: surface.get_supported_alpha_modes(&adapter)[0],
}
```

The function to enumerate supported presentation modes changed:

```diff
- pub fn wgpu::Surface::get_supported_modes(&self, adapter: &wgpu::Adapter) -> Vec<PresentMode>
+ pub fn wgpu::Surface::get_supported_present_modes(&self, adapter: &wgpu::Adapter) -> Vec<PresentMode>
```

#### Updated raw-window-handle to 0.5

This will allow use of the latest version of winit. As such the bound on create_surface is now RWH 0.5 and requires
both `raw_window_handle::HasRawWindowHandle` and `raw_window_handle::HasRawDisplayHandle`.

## wgpu-0.13 (2022-06-30)

### Major Changes

#### WGSL Syntax

WGSL syntax has changed in a couple ways. The new syntax is easier to read and work with.

Attribute declarations are written differently:

```diff
- [[group(1), binding(0)]]
+ @group(1) @binding(0)
```

Stage declarations are now separate attributes rather than part of the `stage` attribute:

```diff
- [[stage(vertex)]]
+ @vertex
```

Structs now use `,` as field separator and no longer need semicolons after the declaration:

```diff
- struct MyStruct {
-     my_member: u32;
- };
+ struct MyStruct {
+     my_member: u32,
+ }
```

#### Surface API

The method of getting the preferred swapchain format has changed to allow viewing all formats supported by the surface.

```diff
- let format = surface.get_preferred_format(&adapter).unwrap();
+ let format = surface.get_supported_formats(&adapter)[0];
```

Presentation modes now need to match exactly what the surface supports. `FIFO` is _always_ supported,
but all other modes vary from API to API and `Device` to `Device`. To get a list of all supported modes,
call the following. The order does not indicate preference.

```rust
let modes = surface.get_supported_present_modes(&adapter);
```

#### Timestamp Queries

Timestamp queries are now restricted behind multiple features to allow implementation on TBDR (Tile-Based Deferred Rendering)
based GPUs, such as mobile devices and Apple's M chips.

`Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERIES` now allows for calling `write_timestamp` only on `CommandEncoder`s.

`Features::WRITE_TIMESTAMP_INSIDE_PASSES` is needed to call `write_timestamp` on `RenderPassEncoder`s or `ComputePassEncoder`s.

#### map_async

The function for mapping buffers no longer returns a future, and instead calls a callback when the buffer is mapped.

This aligns with the use of the API more clearly - you aren't supposed to block and wait on the future to resolve,
you are supposed to keep rendering and wait until the buffer maps on its own. Mapping and the flow of mapping
is an under-documented area that we hope to improve in the future.

```diff
- let future = buffer.slice(..).map_async(MapMode::Read);
+ buffer.slice(..).map_async(MapMode::Read, || {
+     // Called when buffer is mapped.
+ })
```

#### Submission Indexes

Calling `queue.submit` now returns an opaque submission index that can be used as an argument to
`device.poll` to say which submission to wait to complete.

### Other Breaking Changes

`Device::create_shader_module` now takes the shader descriptor by value:

```diff
- device.create_shader_module(&shader_module_descriptor)
+ device.create_shader_module(shader_module_descriptor)
```

Color attachments can be sparse, so they are now optional:

```diff
FragmentState {
-  targets: &[color_target_state]
+  targets: &[Some(color_target_state)]
  // ..
}
```

```diff
RenderPassDescriptor {
-  color_attachments: &[render_pass_color_attachment]
+  color_attachments: &[Some(render_pass_color_attachment)]
  // ..
}
```

```diff
RenderBundleEncoderDescriptor {
-  color_formats: &[texture_format]
+  color_formats: &[Some(texture_format)]
  // ..
}
```

`Extent3d::max_mips` now requires you to pass a TextureDimension to specify whether or not depth_or_array_layers should be ignored:

```diff
Extent3d {
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  depth_or_array_layers: 6,
- }.max_mips()
+ }.max_mips(wgpu::TextureDimension::D3)
```

`Limits` has a new field, [`max_buffer_size`](https://docs.rs/wgpu/0.13.0/wgpu/struct.Limits.html#structfield.max_buffer_size) (not an issue if you don't define limits manually):

```diff
Limits {
  // ...
+ max_buffer_size: 256 * 1024 * 1024, // adjust as you see fit
}
```

`Features::CLEAR_COMMANDS` is now unnecessary and no longer exists. The feature to clear buffers and textures is now part of upstream WebGPU.

```diff
DeviceDescriptor {
  // ...
  features: wgpu::Features::VERTEX_WRITABLE_STORAGE
    | wgpu::Features::MAPPABLE_PRIMARY_BUFFERS
    | wgpu::Features::TEXTURE_BINDING_ARRAY
    | wgpu::Features::BUFFER_BINDING_ARRAY
    | wgpu::Features::STORAGE_RESOURCE_BINDING_ARRAY
-    | wgpu::Features::CLEAR_COMMANDS
  ,
}
```

`ComputePass::dispatch` has been renamed to `ComputePass::dispatch_workgroups`

```diff
- cpass.dispatch(self.work_group_count, 1, 1)
+ cpass.dispatch_workgroups(self.work_group_count, 1, 1)
```

  - passes are now recorded on the client side. The user is also responsible to keep all resources referenced in the pass up until it ends recording.
  - coordinate system is changed to have Y up in the rendering space
  - revised GPU lifetime tracking of all resources
  - revised usage tracking logic
  - all IDs are now non-zero
  - Mailbox present mode
- Validation:
  - active pipeline
- Fixes:
  - lots of small API changes to closely match upstream WebGPU
  - true read-only storage bindings
  - unmapping dropped buffers
  - better error messages on misused swapchain frames
