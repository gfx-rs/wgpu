### New features

#### General

- Many numeric built-ins have had a constant evaluation implementation added for them, which allows them to be used in a `const` context:

- Eager release of GPU resources comes from device.trackers. By @bradwerth in [#5075](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5075)
- `wgpu-types`'s `trace` and `replay` features have been replaced by the `serde` feature. By @KirmesBude in [#5149](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5149)
- `wgpu-core`'s `serial-pass` feature has been removed. Use `serde` instead. By @KirmesBude in [#5149](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5149)
- Added `InstanceFlags::GPU_BASED_VALIDATION`, which enables GPU-based validation for shaders. This is currently only supported on the DX12 and Vulkan backends; other platforms ignore this flag, for now.
  - When set, this flag implies `InstanceFlags::VALIDATION`.
  - This has been added to the set of flags set by `InstanceFlags::advanced_debugging`. Since the overhead is potentially very large, the flag is not enabled by default in debug builds when using `InstanceFlags::from_build_config`.
  - As with other instance flags, this flag can be changed in calls to `InstanceFlags::with_env` with the new `WGPU_GPU_BASED_VALIDATION` environment variable.

  By @ErichDonGubler in [#5146](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5146), [#5046](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5046).

```diff
-wgpu::Instance::any_backend_feature_enabled()
+!wgpu::Instance::enabled_backend_features().is_empty()
```
- `wgpu::CommandEncoder::write_timestamp` requires now the new `wgpu::Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_ENCODERS` feature which is available on all native backends but not on WebGPU (due to a spec change `write_timestamp` is no longer supported on WebGPU). By @wumpf in [#5188](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5188)
- Breaking change: [`wgpu_core::pipeline::ProgrammableStageDescriptor`](https://docs.rs/wgpu-core/latest/wgpu_core/pipeline/struct.ProgrammableStageDescriptor.html#structfield.entry_point) is now optional. By @ErichDonGubler in [#5305](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5305).
- `Features::downlevel{_webgl2,}_features` was made const by @MultisampledNight in [#5343](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5343)

## v0.19.3 (2024-03-01)

This release includes `wgpu`, `wgpu-core`, and `wgpu-hal`. All other crates are unchanged.

### Major Changes

#### Vendored WebGPU Bindings from `web_sys` 

**`--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis` is no longer needed in your `RUSTFLAGS` to compile for WebGPU!!!**

While WebGPU's javascript api is stable in the browsers, the `web_sys` bindings for WebGPU are still improving. As such they are hidden behind the special cfg `--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis` and are not available by default. Everyone who wanted to use our WebGPU backend needed to enable this cfg in their `RUSTFLAGS`. This was very inconvenient and made it hard to use WebGPU, especially when WebGPU is enabled by default. Additionally, the unstable APIs don't adhere to semver, so there were repeated breakages.

To combat this problem we have decided to vendor the `web_sys` bindings for WebGPU within the crate. Notably we are not forking the bindings, merely vendoring, so any improvements we make to the bindings will be contributed directly to upstream `web_sys`.

By @cwfitzgerald in [#5325](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5325).

This includes:
- wgpu-core
- wgpu-hal
- naga
- raw_window_handle
- web_sys

### Feature Flag Changes

#### WebGPU & WebGL in the same Binary

Enabling `webgl` no longer removes the `webgpu` backend.

Instead, there's a new (default enabled) `webgpu` feature that allows to explicitly opt-out of `webgpu` if so desired.
If both `webgl` & `webgpu` are enabled, `wgpu::Instance` decides upon creation whether to target wgpu-core/WebGL or WebGPU.
This means that adapter selection is not handled as with regular adapters, but still allows to decide at runtime whether
`webgpu` or the `webgl` backend should be used using a single wasm binary.
By @wumpf in [#5044](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5044)

#### `naga-ir` Dedicated Feature

The `naga-ir` feature has been added to allow you to add naga module shaders without guessing about what other features needed to be enabled to get access to it.
By @cwfitzgerald in [#5063](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5063).

#### `expose-ids` Feature available unconditionally

This feature allowed you to call `global_id` on any wgpu opaque handle to get a unique hashable identity for the given resource. This is now available without the feature flag.
By @cwfitzgerald in [#4841](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4841).

#### `dx12` and `metal` Backend Crate Features

wgpu now exposes backend feature for the Direct3D 12 (`dx12`) and Metal (`metal`) backend. These are enabled by default, but don't do anything when not targeting the corresponding OS.
By @daxpedda in [#4815](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4815).

### Direct3D 11 Backend Removal

This backend had no functionality, and with the recent support for GL on Desktop, which allows wgpu to run on older devices, there was no need to keep this backend.
By @valaphee in [#4828](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4828).

### `WGPU_ALLOW_UNDERLYING_NONCOMPLIANT_ADAPTER` Environment Variable

This adds a way to allow a Vulkan driver which is non-compliant per `VK_KHR_driver_properties` to be enumerated. This is intended for testing new Vulkan drivers which are not Vulkan compliant yet.
By @i509VCB in [#4754](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4754).

### `DeviceExt::create_texture_with_data` allows Mip-Major Data

Previously, `DeviceExt::create_texture_with_data` only allowed data to be provided in layer major order. There is now a `order` parameter which allows you to specify if the data is in layer major or mip major order.
```diff
    let tex = ctx.device.create_texture_with_data(
        &queue,
        &descriptor,
+       wgpu::util::TextureDataOrder::LayerMajor,
        src_data,
    );
```

By @cwfitzgerald in [#4780](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4780).

### Safe & unified Surface Creation

It is now possible to safely create a `wgpu::Surface` with `wgpu::Instance::create_surface()` by letting `wgpu::Surface` hold a lifetime to `window`.
Passing an owned value `window` to `Surface` will return a `wgpu::Surface<'static>`.

All possible safe variants (owned windows and web canvases) are grouped using `wgpu::SurfaceTarget`.
Conversion to `wgpu::SurfaceTarget` is automatic for any type implementing `raw-window-handle`'s `HasWindowHandle` & `HasDisplayHandle` traits, i.e. most window types.
For web canvas types this has to be done explicitly:
```rust
let surface: wgpu::Surface<'static> = instance.create_surface(wgpu::SurfaceTarget::Canvas(my_canvas))?;
```

All unsafe variants are now grouped under `wgpu::Instance::create_surface_unsafe` which takes the
`wgpu::SurfaceTargetUnsafe` enum and always returns `wgpu::Surface<'static>`.

In order to create a `wgpu::Surface<'static>` without passing ownership of the window use
`wgpu::SurfaceTargetUnsafe::from_window`:
```rust
let surface = unsafe {
  instance.create_surface_unsafe(wgpu::SurfaceTargetUnsafe::from_window(&my_window))?
};
```
The easiest way to make this code safe is to use shared ownership:
```rust
let window: Arc<winit::Window>;
// ...
let surface = instance.create_surface(my_window.clone())?;
```

All platform specific surface creation using points have moved into `SurfaceTargetUnsafe` as well.
For example:

Unification by @wumpf in [#4984](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4984)

### Add partial Support for WGSL Abstract Types

Abstract types make numeric literals easier to use, by
automatically converting literals and other constant expressions
from abstract numeric types to concrete types when safe and
necessary. For example, to build a vector of floating-point
numbers, Naga previously made you write:
```rust
vec3<f32>(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
```
With this change, you can now simply write:
```rust
vec3<f32>(1, 2, 3)
```
Even though the literals are abstract integers, Naga recognizes
that it is safe and necessary to convert them to `f32` values in
order to build the vector. You can also use abstract values as
initializers for global constants and global and local variables,
like this:
```rust
var unit_x: vec2<f32> = vec2(1, 0);
```
The literals `1` and `0` are abstract integers, and the expression
`vec2(1, 0)` is an abstract vector. However, Naga recognizes that
it can convert that to the concrete type `vec2<f32>` to satisfy
the given type of `unit_x`.
The WGSL specification permits abstract integers and
floating-point values in almost all contexts, but Naga's support
for this is still incomplete. Many WGSL operators and builtin
functions are specified to produce abstract results when applied
to abstract inputs, but for now Naga simply concretizes them all
before applying the operation. We will expand Naga's abstract type
support in subsequent pull requests.
As part of this work, the public types `naga::ScalarKind` and
`naga::Literal` now have new variants, `AbstractInt` and `AbstractFloat`.

By @jimblandy in [#4743](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4743), [#4755](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4755).

### `Instance::enumerate_adapters` now returns `Vec<Adapter>` instead of an `ExactSizeIterator`

This allows us to support WebGPU and WebGL in the same binary.

```diff
- let adapters: Vec<Adapter> = instance.enumerate_adapters(wgpu::Backends::all()).collect();
+ let adapters: Vec<Adapter> = instance.enumerate_adapters(wgpu::Backends::all());
```

By @wumpf in [#5044](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5044)

### `device.poll()` now returns a `MaintainResult` instead of a `bool`

This is a forward looking change, as we plan to add more information to the `MaintainResult` in the future.
This enum has the same data as the boolean, but with some useful helper functions.

```diff
- let queue_finished: bool = device.poll(wgpu::Maintain::Wait);
+ let queue_finished: bool = device.poll(wgpu::Maintain::Wait).is_queue_empty();
```

By @cwfitzgerald in [#5053](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5053)

### New Features

#### General
- Added `DownlevelFlags::VERTEX_AND_INSTANCE_INDEX_RESPECTS_RESPECTIVE_FIRST_VALUE_IN_INDIRECT_DRAW` to know if `@builtin(vertex_index)` and `@builtin(instance_index)` will respect the `first_vertex` / `first_instance` in indirect calls. If this is not present, both will always start counting from 0. Currently enabled on all backends except DX12. By @cwfitzgerald in [#4722](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4722).
- Added support for the `FLOAT32_FILTERABLE` feature (web and native, corresponds to WebGPU's `float32-filterable`). By @almarklein in [#4759](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4759).
- GPU buffer memory is released during "lose the device". By @bradwerth in [#4851](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4851).
- wgpu and wgpu-core cargo feature flags are now documented on docs.rs. By @wumpf in [#4886](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4886).
- DeviceLostClosure is guaranteed to be invoked exactly once. By @bradwerth in [#4862](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4862).
- Log vulkan validation layer messages during instance creation and destruction: By @exrook in [#4586](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4586).
- `TextureFormat::block_size` is deprecated, use `TextureFormat::block_copy_size` instead: By @wumpf in [#4647](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4647).
- Rename of `DispatchIndirect`, `DrawIndexedIndirect`, and `DrawIndirect` types in the `wgpu::util` module to `DispatchIndirectArgs`, `DrawIndexedIndirectArgs`, and `DrawIndirectArgs`. By @cwfitzgerald in [#4723](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4723).
- Make the size parameter of `encoder.clear_buffer` an `Option<u64>` instead of `Option<NonZero<u64>>`. By @nical in [#4737](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4737).
- Reduce the `info` log level noise. By @nical in [#4769](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4769), [#4711](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4711) and [#4772](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4772)
- Rename `features` & `limits` fields of `DeviceDescriptor` to `required_features` & `required_limits`. By @teoxoy in [#4803](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4803).
- `SurfaceConfiguration` now exposes `desired_maximum_frame_latency` which was previously hard-coded to 2. By setting it to 1 you can reduce latency under the risk of making GPU & CPU work sequential. Currently, on DX12 this affects the `MaximumFrameLatency`, on all other backends except OpenGL the size of the swapchain (on OpenGL this has no effect). By @emilk & @wumpf in [#4899](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4899)

#### OpenGL
- `@builtin(instance_index)` now properly reflects the range provided in the draw call instead of always counting from 0. By @cwfitzgerald in [#4722](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4722).
- Desktop GL now supports `POLYGON_MODE_LINE` and `POLYGON_MODE_POINT`. By @valaphee in [#4836](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4836).

#### Naga

- Naga's WGSL front end now allows operators to produce values with abstract types, rather than concretizing thir operands. By @jimblandy in [#4850](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4850) and [#4870](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4870).
- Naga's WGSL front and back ends now have experimental support for 64-bit floating-point literals: `1.0lf` denotes an `f64` value. There has been experimental support for an `f64` type for a while, but until now there was no syntax for writing literals with that type. As before, Naga module validation rejects `f64` values unless `naga::valid::Capabilities::FLOAT64` is requested. By @jimblandy in [#4747](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4747).
- Naga constant evaluation can now process binary operators whose operands are both vectors. By @jimblandy in [#4861](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4861).
- Add `--bulk-validate` option to Naga CLI. By @jimblandy in [#4871](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4871).
- Naga's `cargo xtask validate` now runs validation jobs in parallel, using the [jobserver](https://crates.io/crates/jobserver) protocol to limit concurrency, and offers a `validate all` subcommand, which runs all available validation types. By @jimblandy in [#4902](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4902).
- Remove `span` and `validate` features. Always fully validate shader modules, and always track source positions for use in error messages. By @teoxoy in [#4706](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4706).
- Introduce a new `Scalar` struct type for use in Naga's IR, and update all frontend, middle, and backend code appropriately. By @jimblandy in [#4673](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4673).
- Add more metal keywords. By @fornwall in [#4707](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4707).
- Add a new `naga::Literal` variant, `I64`, for signed 64-bit literals. [#4711](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4711).
- Emit and init `struct` member padding always. By @ErichDonGubler in [#4701](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4701).
- In WGSL output, always include the `i` suffix on `i32` literals. By @jimblandy in [#4863](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4863).
- In WGSL output, always include the `f` suffix on `f32` literals. By @jimblandy in [#4869](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4869).

### Bug Fixes

#### General

- `BufferMappedRange` trait is now `WasmNotSendSync`, i.e. it is `Send`/`Sync` if not on wasm or `fragile-send-sync-non-atomic-wasm` is enabled. By @wumpf in [#4818](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4818).
- Align `wgpu_types::CompositeAlphaMode` serde serialization to spec. By @littledivy in [#4940](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4940).

- No longer validate surfaces against their allowed extent range on configure. This caused warnings that were almost impossible to avoid. As before, the resulting behavior depends on the compositor. By @wumpf in [#4796](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4796).

#### DX12

- Fixed D3D12_SUBRESOURCE_FOOTPRINT calculation for block compressed textures which caused a crash with `Queue::write_texture` on DX12. By @DTZxPorter in [#4990](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4990).

#### Vulkan

Correct the WGSL generated for constructing 64-bit floating-point matrices. Add tests for all the above. By @jimblandy in [#4684](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4684).
- Allow Naga's IR types to represent matrices with elements elements of any scalar kind. This makes it possible for Naga IR types to represent WGSL abstract matrices. By @jimblandy in [#4735](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4735).
- Preserve the source spans for constants and expressions correctly across module compaction. By @jimblandy in [#4696](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4696).

### Bug Fixes

#### Naga
- When evaluating const-expressions and generating SPIR-V, properly handle `Compose` expressions whose operands are `Splat` expressions. Such expressions are created and marked as constant by the constant evaluator. By @jimblandy in [#4695](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4695).

For naga changelogs at or before v0.14.0. See [naga's changelog](naga/CHANGELOG.md).

### Desktop OpenGL 3.3+ Support on Windows

We now support OpenGL on Windows! This brings support for a vast majority of the hardware that used to be covered by our DX11 backend. As of this writing we support OpenGL 3.3+, though there are efforts to reduce that further.

This allows us to cover the last 12 years of Intel GPUs (starting with Ivy Bridge; aka 3xxx), and the last 16 years of AMD (starting with Terascale; aka HD 2000) / NVidia GPUs (starting with Tesla; aka GeForce 8xxx).

By @Zoxc in [#4248](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4248)

### Timestamp Queries Supported on Metal and OpenGL

Timestamp queries are now supported on both Metal and Desktop OpenGL. On Apple chips on Metal, they only support timestamp queries in command buffers or in the renderpass descriptor,
they do not support them inside a pass.

Metal: By @Wumpf in [#4008](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4008)
OpenGL: By @Zoxc in [#4267](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4267)

### Render/Compute Pass Query Writes

Addition of the `TimestampWrites` type to compute and render pass descriptors to allow profiling on tilers which do not support timestamps inside passes.

Added [an example](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/tree/trunk/examples/timestamp-queries) to demonstrate the various kinds of timestamps.

Additionally, metal now supports timestamp queries!

By @FL33TW00D & @wumpf in [#3636](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3636).

### Occlusion Queries

We now support binary occlusion queries! This allows you to determine if any of the draw calls within the query drew any pixels.

Use the new `occlusion_query_set` field on `RenderPassDescriptor` to give a query set that occlusion queries will write to.

```diff
let mut rpass = encoder.begin_render_pass(&wgpu::RenderPassDescriptor {
    // ...
+   occlusion_query_set: Some(&my_occlusion_query_set),
});
```

Within the renderpass do the following to write the occlusion query results to the query set at the given index:

```rust
rpass.begin_occlusion_query(index);
rpass.draw(...);
rpass.draw(...);
rpass.end_occlusion_query();
```

These are binary occlusion queries, so the result will be either 0 or an unspecified non-zero value.

By @Valaphee in [#3402](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3402)

### Shader Improvements

```rust
// WGSL constant expressions are now supported!
const BLAH: u32 = 1u + 1u;

// `rgb10a2uint` and `bgra8unorm` can now be used as a storage image format.
var image: texture_storage_2d<rgb10a2uint, write>;
var image: texture_storage_2d<bgra8unorm, write>;

// You can now use dual source blending!
struct FragmentOutput{
    @location(0) source1: vec4<f32>,
    @location(0) @second_blend_source source2: vec4<f32>,
}

// `modf`/`frexp` now return structures
let result = modf(1.5);
result.fract == 0.5;
result.whole == 1.0;

let result = frexp(1.5);
result.fract == 0.75;
result.exponent == 2i;

// `modf`/`frexp` are currently disabled on GLSL and SPIR-V input.
```

### Shader Validation Improvements

```rust
// Cannot get pointer to a workgroup variable
fn func(p: ptr<workgroup, u32>); // ERROR

// Cannot create Inf/NaN through constant expressions
const INF: f32 = 3.40282347e+38 + 1.0; // ERROR
const NAN: f32 = 0.0 / 0.0; // ERROR

// `outerProduct` function removed

// Error on repeated or missing `@workgroup_size()`
@workgroup_size(1) @workgroup_size(2) // ERROR
fn compute_main() {}

// Error on repeated attributes.
fn fragment_main(@location(0) @location(0) location_0: f32) // ERROR
```

### RenderPass `StoreOp` is now Enumeration

`wgpu::Operations::store` used to be an underdocumented boolean value,
causing misunderstandings of the effect of setting it to `false`.

The API now more closely resembles WebGPU which distinguishes between `store` and `discard`,
see [WebGPU spec on GPUStoreOp](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#enumdef-gpustoreop).

```diff
// ...
depth_ops: Some(wgpu::Operations {
    load: wgpu::LoadOp::Clear(1.0),
-   store: false,
+   store: wgpu::StoreOp::Discard,
}),
// ...
```

By @wumpf in [#4147](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4147)

### Instance Descriptor Settings

The instance descriptor grew two more fields: `flags` and `gles_minor_version`.

`flags` allow you to toggle the underlying api validation layers, debug information about shaders and objects in capture programs, and the ability to discard labels

`gles_minor_version` is a rather niche feature that allows you to force the GLES backend to use a specific minor version, this is useful to get ANGLE to enable more than GLES 3.0.

```diff
let instance = wgpu::Instance::new(InstanceDescriptor {
    ...
+   flags: wgpu::InstanceFlags::default()
+   gles_minor_version: wgpu::Gles3MinorVersion::Automatic,
});
```

`gles_minor_version`: By @PJB3005 in [#3998](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3998)
`flags`: By @nical in [#4230](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4230)

### Revamped Testing Suite

Our testing harness was completely revamped and now automatically runs against all gpus in the system, shows the expected status of every test, and is tolerant to flakes.

Additionally, we have filled out our CI to now run the latest versions of WARP and Mesa. This means we can test even more features on CI than before.

By @cwfitzgerald in [#3873](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3873)

### Major Changes

This release was fairly minor as breaking changes go.

#### `wgpu` types now `!Send` `!Sync` on wasm

Up until this point, wgpu has made the assumption that threads do not exist on wasm. With the rise of libraries like [`wasm_thread`](https://crates.io/crates/wasm_thread) making it easier and easier to do wasm multithreading this assumption is no longer sound. As all wgpu objects contain references into the JS heap, they cannot leave the thread they started on.

As we understand that this change might be very inconvenient for users who don't care about wasm threading, there is a crate feature which re-enables the old behavior: `fragile-send-sync-non-atomic-wasm`. So long as you don't compile your code with `-Ctarget-feature=+atomics`, `Send` and `Sync` will be implemented again on wgpu types on wasm. As the name implies, especially for libraries, this is very fragile, as you don't know if a user will want to compile with atomics (and therefore threads) or not.

By @daxpedda in [#3691](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3691)

#### Power Preference is now optional

The `power_preference` field of `RequestAdapterOptions` is now optional. If it is `PowerPreference::None`, we will choose the first available adapter, preferring GPU adapters over CPU adapters.

By @Aaron1011 in [#3903](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3903)

#### `initialize_adapter_from_env` argument changes

Removed the backend_bits parameter from `initialize_adapter_from_env` and `initialize_adapter_from_env_or_default`. If you want to limit the backends used by this function, only enable the wanted backends in the instance.

Added a compatible surface parameter, to ensure the given device is able to be presented onto the given surface.

```diff
- wgpu::util::initialize_adapter_from_env(instance, backend_bits);
+ wgpu::util::initialize_adapter_from_env(instance, Some(&compatible_surface));
```

## v0.16.0 (2023-04-19)

### Major changes

#### Shader Changes

`type` has been replaced with `alias` to match with upstream WebGPU.

```diff
- type MyType = vec4<u32>;
+ alias MyType = vec4<u32>;
```

#### TextureFormat info API

The `TextureFormat::describe` function was removed in favor of separate functions: `block_dimensions`, `is_compressed`, `is_srgb`, `required_features`, `guaranteed_format_features`, `sample_type` and `block_size`.


```diff
- let block_dimensions = format.describe().block_dimensions;
+ let block_dimensions = format.block_dimensions();
- let is_compressed = format.describe().is_compressed();
+ let is_compressed = format.is_compressed();
- let is_srgb = format.describe().srgb;
+ let is_srgb = format.is_srgb();
- let required_features = format.describe().required_features;
+ let required_features = format.required_features();
```

Additionally `guaranteed_format_features` now takes a set of features to assume are enabled.

```diff
- let guaranteed_format_features = format.describe().guaranteed_format_features;
+ let guaranteed_format_features = format.guaranteed_format_features(device.features());
```

Additionally `sample_type` and `block_size` now take an optional `TextureAspect` and return `Option`s.

```diff
- let sample_type = format.describe().sample_type;
+ let sample_type = format.sample_type(None).expect("combined depth-stencil format requires specifying a TextureAspect");
- let block_size = format.describe().block_size;
+ let block_size = format.block_size(None).expect("combined depth-stencil format requires specifying a TextureAspect");
```

By @teoxoy in [#3436](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3436)

#### BufferUsages::QUERY_RESOLVE

Buffers used as the `destination` argument of `CommandEncoder::resolve_query_set` now have to contain the `QUERY_RESOLVE` usage instead of the `COPY_DST` usage.

```diff
  let destination = device.create_buffer(&wgpu::BufferDescriptor {
      // ...
-     usage: wgpu::BufferUsages::COPY_DST | wgpu::BufferUsages::MAP_READ,
+     usage: wgpu::BufferUsages::QUERY_RESOLVE | wgpu::BufferUsages::MAP_READ,
      mapped_at_creation: false,
  });
  command_encoder.resolve_query_set(&query_set, query_range, &destination, destination_offset);
```

By @JolifantoBambla in [#3489](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3489)

#### Renamed features

The following `Features` have been renamed.

- `SHADER_FLOAT16` -> `SHADER_F16`
- `SHADER_FLOAT64` -> `SHADER_F64`
- `SHADER_INT16` -> `SHADER_I16`
- `TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_ASTC_LDR` -> `TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_ASTC`
- `WRITE_TIMESTAMP_INSIDE_PASSES` -> `TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES`

By @teoxoy in [#3534](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3534)

#### Anisotropic Filtering

Anisotropic filtering has been brought in line with the spec. The anisotropic clamp is now a `u16` (was a `Option<u8>`) which must be at least 1.

If the anisotropy clamp is not 1, all the filters in a sampler must be `Linear`.

```diff
SamplerDescriptor {
-    anisotropic_clamp: None,
+    anisotropic_clamp: 1,
}
```

By @cwfitzgerald in [#3610](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3610).

#### TextureFormat Names

Some texture format names have changed to get back in line with the spec.

```diff
- TextureFormat::Bc6hRgbSfloat
+ TextureFormat::Bc6hRgbFloat
```

By @cwfitzgerald in [#3671](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3671).

## wgpu-0.15.0 (2023-01-25)

### Major Changes


#### WGSL Top-Level `let` is now `const`

All top level constants are now declared with `const`, catching up with the wgsl spec.

`let` is no longer allowed at the global scope, only within functions.

```diff
-let SOME_CONSTANT = 12.0;
+const SOME_CONSTANT = 12.0;
```

See https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v011-2023-01-25 for smaller shader improvements.

#### Surface Capabilities API

The various surface capability functions were combined into a single call that gives you all the capabilities.

```diff
- let formats = surface.get_supported_formats(&adapter);
- let present_modes = surface.get_supported_present_modes(&adapter);
- let alpha_modes = surface.get_supported_alpha_modes(&adapter);
+ let caps = surface.get_capabilities(&adapter);
+ let formats = caps.formats;
+ let present_modes = caps.present_modes;
+ let alpha_modes = caps.alpha_modes;
```

Additionally `Surface::get_default_config` now returns an Option and returns None if the surface isn't supported by the adapter.

```diff
- let config = surface.get_default_config(&adapter);
+ let config = surface.get_default_config(&adapter).expect("Surface unsupported by adapter");
```

#### Fallible surface creation

`Instance::create_surface()` now returns `Result<Surface, CreateSurfaceError>` instead of `Surface`. This allows an error to be returned if the given window is a HTML canvas and obtaining a WebGPU or WebGL 2 context fails. (No other platforms currently report any errors through this path.) By @kpreid in [#3052](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3052/)

#### `Queue::copy_external_image_to_texture` on WebAssembly

A new api, `Queue::copy_external_image_to_texture`, allows you to create wgpu textures from various web image primitives. Specifically from `HtmlVideoElement`, `HtmlCanvasElement`, `OffscreenCanvas`, and `ImageBitmap`. This provides multiple low-copy ways of interacting with the browser. WebGL is also supported, though WebGL has some additional restrictions, represented by the `UNRESTRICTED_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_COPIES` downlevel flag. By @cwfitzgerald in [#3288](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3288)

#### Instance creation now takes `InstanceDescriptor` instead of `Backends`

`Instance::new()` and `hub::Global::new()` now take an `InstanceDescriptor` struct which contains both the existing `Backends` selection as well as a new `Dx12Compiler` field for selecting which Dx12 shader compiler to use.

```diff
- let instance = Instance::new(wgpu::Backends::all());
+ let instance = Instance::new(wgpu::InstanceDescriptor {
+     backends: wgpu::Backends::all(),
+     dx12_shader_compiler: wgpu::Dx12Compiler::Fxc,
+ });
```

`Instance` now also also implements `Default`, which uses `wgpu::Backends::all()` and `wgpu::Dx12Compiler::Fxc` for `InstanceDescriptor`

```diff
- let instance = Instance::new(wgpu::InstanceDescriptor {
-     backends: wgpu::Backends::all(),
-     dx12_shader_compiler: wgpu::Dx12Compiler::Fxc,
- });
+ let instance = Instance::default();
```

By @Elabajaba in [#3356](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3356)

#### Texture Format Reinterpretation

The new `view_formats` field in the `TextureDescriptor` is used to specify a list of formats the texture can be re-interpreted to in a texture view. Currently only changing srgb-ness is allowed (ex. `Rgba8Unorm` <=> `Rgba8UnormSrgb`).

```diff
let texture = device.create_texture(&wgpu::TextureDescriptor {
  // ...
  format: TextureFormat::Rgba8UnormSrgb,
+ view_formats: &[TextureFormat::Rgba8Unorm],
});
```

```diff
let config = wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration {
  // ...
  format: TextureFormat::Rgba8Unorm,
+ view_formats: vec![wgpu::TextureFormat::Rgba8UnormSrgb],
};
surface.configure(&device, &config);
```

#### MSAA x2 and x8 Support

Via the `TEXTURE_ADAPTER_SPECIFIC_FORMAT_FEATURES` feature, MSAA x2 and x8 are now supported on textures. To query for x2 or x8 support, enable the feature and look at the texture format flags for the texture format of your choice.

By @39ali in [3140](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3140)

#### DXC Shader Compiler Support for DX12

You can now choose to use the DXC compiler for DX12 instead of FXC. The DXC compiler is faster, less buggy, and allows for new features compared to the old, unmaintained FXC compiler.

You can choose which compiler to use at `Instance` creation using the `dx12_shader_compiler` field in the `InstanceDescriptor` struct. Note that DXC requires both `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll`, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases. Both .dlls need to be shipped with your application when targeting DX12 and using the `DXC` compiler. If the .dlls can't be loaded, then it will fall back to the FXC compiler. By @39ali and @Elabajaba in [#3356](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3356)

#### Suballocate DX12 buffers and textures

The DX12 backend can now suballocate buffers and textures from larger chunks of memory, which can give a significant increase in performance (in testing a 100x improvement has been seen in a simple scene with 200 `write_buffer` calls per frame, and a 1.4x improvement in [Bistro using Bevy](https://github.com/vleue/bevy_bistro_playground)).

Previously `wgpu-hal`'s DX12 backend created a new heap on the GPU every time you called `write_buffer` (by calling `CreateCommittedResource`), whereas now it uses [`gpu_allocator`](https://crates.io/crates/gpu-allocator) to manage GPU memory (and calls `CreatePlacedResource` with a suballocated heap). By @Elabajaba in [#3163](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/3163)

#### Backend selection by features in wgpu-core

Whereas `wgpu-core` used to automatically select backends to enable
based on the target OS and architecture, it now has separate features
to enable each backend:

- "metal", for the Metal API on macOS and iOS
- "vulkan", for the Vulkan API (Linux, some Android, and occasionally Windows)
- "dx12", for Microsoft's Direct3D 12 API
- "gles", OpenGL ES, available on many systems
- "dx11", for Microsoft's Direct3D 11 API

None are enabled by default, but the `wgpu` crate automatically
selects these features based on the target operating system and
architecture, using the same rules that `wgpu-core` used to, so users
of `wgpu` should be unaffected by this change. However, other crates
using `wgpu-core` directly will need to copy `wgpu`'s logic or write
their own. See the `[target]` section of `wgpu/Cargo.toml` for
details.

Similarly, `wgpu-core` now has `emscripten` and `renderdoc` features
that `wgpu` enables on appropriate platforms.

In previous releases, the `wgpu-core` crate decided which backends to
support. However, this left `wgpu-core`'s users with no way to
override those choices. (Firefox doesn't want the GLES back end, for
example.) There doesn't seem to be any way to have a crate select
backends based on target OS and architecture that users of that crate
can still override. Default features can't be selected based on the
target, for example. That implies that we should do the selection as
late in the dependency DAG as feasible. Having `wgpu` (and
`wgpu-core`'s other dependents) choose backends seems like the best
option.

## wgpu-0.14.0 (2022-10-05)

### Major Changes

#### @invariant Warning

When using CompareFunction::Equal or CompareFunction::NotEqual on a pipeline, there is now a warning logged if the vertex
shader does not have a @invariant tag on it. On some machines, rendering the same triangles multiple times without an
@invariant tag will result in slightly different depths for every pixel. Because the \*Equal functions rely on depth being
the same every time it is rendered, we now warn if it is missing.

```diff
-@vertex
-fn vert_main(v_in: VertexInput) -> @builtin(position) vec4<f32> {...}
+@vertex
+fn vert_main(v_in: VertexInput) -> @builtin(position) @invariant vec4<f32> {...}
```

#### Surface Alpha and PresentModes

Surface supports `alpha_mode` now. When alpha_mode is equal to `PreMultiplied` or `PostMultiplied`,
the alpha channel of framebuffer is respected in the compositing process, but which mode is available depends on
the different API and `Device`. If don't care about alpha_mode, you can set it to `Auto`.

```diff
SurfaceConfiguration {
// ...
+ alpha_mode: surface.get_supported_alpha_modes(&adapter)[0],
}
```

The function to enumerate supported presentation modes changed:

```diff
- pub fn wgpu::Surface::get_supported_modes(&self, adapter: &wgpu::Adapter) -> Vec<PresentMode>
+ pub fn wgpu::Surface::get_supported_present_modes(&self, adapter: &wgpu::Adapter) -> Vec<PresentMode>
```

#### Updated raw-window-handle to 0.5

This will allow use of the latest version of winit. As such the bound on create_surface is now RWH 0.5 and requires
both `raw_window_handle::HasRawWindowHandle` and `raw_window_handle::HasRawDisplayHandle`.

## wgpu-0.13 (2022-06-30)

### Major Changes

#### WGSL Syntax

WGSL syntax has changed in a couple ways. The new syntax is easier to read and work with.

Attribute declarations are written differently:

```diff
- [[group(1), binding(0)]]
+ @group(1) @binding(0)
```

Stage declarations are now separate attributes rather than part of the `stage` attribute:

```diff
- [[stage(vertex)]]
+ @vertex
```

Structs now use `,` as field separator and no longer need semicolons after the declaration:

```diff
- struct MyStruct {
-     my_member: u32;
- };
+ struct MyStruct {
+     my_member: u32,
+ }
```

#### Surface API

The method of getting the preferred swapchain format has changed to allow viewing all formats supported by the surface.

```diff
- let format = surface.get_preferred_format(&adapter).unwrap();
+ let format = surface.get_supported_formats(&adapter)[0];
```

Presentation modes now need to match exactly what the surface supports. `FIFO` is _always_ supported,
but all other modes vary from API to API and `Device` to `Device`. To get a list of all supported modes,
call the following. The order does not indicate preference.

```rust
let modes = surface.get_supported_present_modes(&adapter);
```

#### Timestamp Queries

Timestamp queries are now restricted behind multiple features to allow implementation on TBDR (Tile-Based Deferred Rendering)
based GPUs, such as mobile devices and Apple's M chips.

`Features::TIMESTAMP_QUERIES` now allows for calling `write_timestamp` only on `CommandEncoder`s.

`Features::WRITE_TIMESTAMP_INSIDE_PASSES` is needed to call `write_timestamp` on `RenderPassEncoder`s or `ComputePassEncoder`s.

#### map_async

The function for mapping buffers no longer returns a future, and instead calls a callback when the buffer is mapped.

This aligns with the use of the API more clearly - you aren't supposed to block and wait on the future to resolve,
you are supposed to keep rendering and wait until the buffer maps on its own. Mapping and the flow of mapping
is an under-documented area that we hope to improve in the future.

```diff
- let future = buffer.slice(..).map_async(MapMode::Read);
+ buffer.slice(..).map_async(MapMode::Read, || {
+     // Called when buffer is mapped.
+ })
```

#### Submission Indexes

Calling `queue.submit` now returns an opaque submission index that can be used as an argument to
`device.poll` to say which submission to wait to complete.

### Other Breaking Changes

`Device::create_shader_module` now takes the shader descriptor by value:

```diff
- device.create_shader_module(&shader_module_descriptor)
+ device.create_shader_module(shader_module_descriptor)
```

Color attachments can be sparse, so they are now optional:

```diff
FragmentState {
-  targets: &[color_target_state]
+  targets: &[Some(color_target_state)]
  // ..
}
```

```diff
RenderPassDescriptor {
-  color_attachments: &[render_pass_color_attachment]
+  color_attachments: &[Some(render_pass_color_attachment)]
  // ..
}
```

```diff
RenderBundleEncoderDescriptor {
-  color_formats: &[texture_format]
+  color_formats: &[Some(texture_format)]
  // ..
}
```

`Extent3d::max_mips` now requires you to pass a TextureDimension to specify whether or not depth_or_array_layers should be ignored:

```diff
Extent3d {
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  depth_or_array_layers: 6,
- }.max_mips()
+ }.max_mips(wgpu::TextureDimension::D3)
```

`Limits` has a new field, [`max_buffer_size`](https://docs.rs/wgpu/0.13.0/wgpu/struct.Limits.html#structfield.max_buffer_size) (not an issue if you don't define limits manually):

```diff
Limits {
  // ...
+ max_buffer_size: 256 * 1024 * 1024, // adjust as you see fit
}
```

`Features::CLEAR_COMMANDS` is now unnecessary and no longer exists. The feature to clear buffers and textures is now part of upstream WebGPU.

```diff
DeviceDescriptor {
  // ...
  features: wgpu::Features::VERTEX_WRITABLE_STORAGE
    | wgpu::Features::MAPPABLE_PRIMARY_BUFFERS
    | wgpu::Features::TEXTURE_BINDING_ARRAY
    | wgpu::Features::BUFFER_BINDING_ARRAY
    | wgpu::Features::STORAGE_RESOURCE_BINDING_ARRAY
-    | wgpu::Features::CLEAR_COMMANDS
  ,
}
```

`ComputePass::dispatch` has been renamed to `ComputePass::dispatch_workgroups`

```diff
- cpass.dispatch(self.work_group_count, 1, 1)
+ cpass.dispatch_workgroups(self.work_group_count, 1, 1)
```

  - processing SPIR-V inputs for later translation now requires `spirv` compile feature enabled
  - new `Features::SPIRV_SHADER_PASSTHROUGH` run-time feature allows providing pass-through SPIR-V (orthogonal to the compile feature)
  - several bitflag names are renamed to plural: `TextureUsage`, `BufferUsage`, `ColorWrite`.
  - the `SwapChain` is merged into `Surface`. Returned frames are `Texture` instead of `TextureView`.
  - renamed `TextureUsage` bits: `SAMPLED` -> `TEXTURE_BINDING`, `STORAGE` -> `STORAGE_BINDING`.
  - renamed `InputStepMode` to `VertexStepMode`.
  - readable storage textures are no longer a part of the base API. Only exposed via format-specific features, non-portably.
