/*!
Backend for [GLSL][glsl] (OpenGL Shading Language).

The main structure is [`Writer`], it maintains internal state that is used
to output a [`Module`](crate::Module) into glsl

# Supported versions
### Core
- 330
- 400
- 410
- 420
- 430
- 450

### ES
- 300
- 310

// GLSL is mostly a superset of C but it also removes some parts of it this is a list of relevant
// aspects for this backend.
//
// The most notable change is the introduction of the version preprocessor directive that must
// always be the first line of a glsl file and is written as
// `#version number profile`
// `number` is the version itself (i.e. 300) and `profile` is the
// shader profile we only support "core" and "es", the former is used in desktop applications and
// the later is used in embedded contexts, mobile devices and browsers. Each one as it's own
// versions (at the time of writing this the latest version for "core" is 460 and for "es" is 320)
//
// Other important preprocessor addition is the extension directive which is written as
// `#extension name: behaviour`
// Extensions provide increased features in a plugin fashion but they aren't required to be
// supported hence why they are called extensions, that's why `behaviour` is used it specifies
// whether the extension is strictly required or if it should only be enabled if needed. In our case
// when we use extensions we set behaviour to `require` always.
//
// The only thing that glsl removes that makes a difference are pointers.
//
// Additions that are relevant for the backend are the discard keyword, the introduction of
// vector, matrices, samplers, image types and functions that provide common shader operations
