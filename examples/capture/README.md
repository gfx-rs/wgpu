# capture

This example shows how to capture an image by rendering it to a texture, copying the texture to
a buffer, and retrieving it from the buffer.

This could be used for "taking a screenshot," with the added benefit that this method doesn't
require a window to be created.

## To Run

```
cargo run --bin capture
open examples/capture/red.png
```
