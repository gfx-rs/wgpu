# render_to_texture

Similar to hello-triangle but instead of rendering to a window or canvas, renders to a texture that is then output as an image like the storage-texture example.

If all goes well, the end result should look familiarly like hello-triangle with its red triangle on a green background.

## To Run

```
cargo run --bin wgpu-examples render_to_texture
```
