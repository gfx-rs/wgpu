//! Texture Trackers
//!
//! Texture trackers are significantly more complicated than
//! the buffer trackers because textures can be in a "complex"
//! state where each individual subresource can potentially be
//! in a different state from every other subtresource. These
//! complex states are stored separately from the simple states
//! because they are signifignatly more difficult to track and
//! most resources spend the vast majority of their lives in
//! simple states.
//!
//! There are two special texture usages: `UNKNOWN` and `UNINITIALIZED`.
//! - `UNKNOWN` is only used in complex states and is used to signify
//!   that the complex state does not know anything about those subresources.
//!   It cannot leak into transitions, it is invalid to transition into UNKNOWN
//!   state.
//! - `UNINITIALIZED` is used in both simple and complex states to mean the texture
//!   is known to be in some undefined state. Any transition away from UNINITIALIZED
//!   will treat the contents as junk.
