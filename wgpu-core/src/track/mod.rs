/*! Resource State and Lifetime Trackers

These structures are responsible for keeping track of resource state,
generating barriers where needed, and making sure resources are kept
alive until the trackers die.

## General Architecture

Tracking is some of the hottest code in the entire codebase, so the trackers
are designed to be as cache efficient as possible. They store resource state
in flat vectors, storing metadata SOA style, one vector per type of metadata.

A lot of the tracker code is deeply unsafe, using unchecked accesses all over
to make performance as good as possible. However, for all unsafe accesses, there
is a corresponding debug assert the checks if that access is valid. This helps
get bugs caught fast, while still letting users not need to pay for the bounds
checks.

In wgpu, resource IDs are allocated and re-used, so will always be as low
as reasonably possible. This allows us to use the ID as an index into an array.

## Statefulness

There are two main types of trackers, stateful and stateless.

Stateful trackers are for buffers and textures. They both have
resource state attached to them which needs to be used to generate
automatic synchronization. Because of the different requirements of
buffers and textures, they have two separate tracking structures.

Stateless trackers only store metadata and own the given resource.

## Use Case

Within each type of tracker, the trackers are further split into 3 different
use cases, Bind Group, Usage Scope, and a full Tracker.

Bind Group trackers are just a list of different resources, their refcount,
and how they are used. Textures are used via a selector and a usage type.
Buffers by just a usage type. Stateless resources don't have a usage type.

Usage Scope trackers are only for stateful resources. These trackers represent
a single [`UsageScope`] in the spec. When a use is added to a usage scope,
it is merged with all other uses of that resource in that scope. If there
is a usage conflict, merging will fail and an error will be reported.

Full trackers represent a before and after state of a resource. These
are used for tracking on the device and on command buffers. The before
state represents the state the resource is first used as in the command buffer,
the after state is the state the command buffer leaves the resource in.
These double ended buffers can then be used to generate the needed transitions
between command buffers.

## Dense Datastructure with Sparse Data

This tracking system is based on having completely dense data, but trackers do
not always contain every resource. Some resources (or even most resources) go
unused in any given command buffer. So to help speed up the process of iterating
through possibly thousands of resources, we use a bit vector to represent if
a resource is in the buffer or not. This allows us extremely efficient memory
utilization, as well as being able to bail out of whole blocks of 32-64 resources
with a single usize comparison with zero. In practice this means that merging
partially resident buffers is extremely quick.

The main advantage of this dense datastructure is that we can do merging
of trackers in an extremely efficient fashion that results in us doing linear
scans down a couple of buffers. CPUs and their caches absolutely eat this up.

## Stateful Resource Operations

All operations on stateful trackers boil down to one of four operations:
- `insert(tracker, new_state)` adds a resource with a given state to the tracker
  for the first time.
- `merge(tracker, new_state)` merges this new state with the previous state, checking
  for usage conflicts.
- `barrier(tracker, new_state)` compares the given state to the existing state and
  generates the needed barriers.
- `update(tracker, new_state)` takes the given new state and overrides the old state.

This allows us to compose the operations to form the various kinds of tracker merges
that need to happen in the codebase. For each resource in the given merger, the following
operation applies:

```text
UsageScope <- Resource = insert(scope, usage) OR merge(scope, usage)
UsageScope <- UsageScope = insert(scope, scope) OR merge(scope, scope)
CommandBuffer <- UsageScope = insert(buffer.start, buffer.end, scope)
                              OR barrier(buffer.end, scope) + update(buffer.end, scope)
Device <- CommandBuffer = insert(device.start, device.end, buffer.start, buffer.end)
                          OR barrier(device.end, buffer.start) + update(device.end, buffer.end)
```
