/// ## Host mapping buffers
///
/// A buffer cannot be mapped until all active queue submissions that use it
/// have completed. To that end:
///
/// -   Each buffer's `ResourceInfo::submission_index` records the index of the
///     most recent queue submission that uses that buffer.
///
/// -   Calling `Global::buffer_map_async` adds the buffer to
///     `self.mapped`, and changes `Buffer::map_state` to prevent it
///     from being used in any new submissions.
///
/// -   When the device is polled, the following `LifetimeTracker` methods decide
///     what should happen next:
///
///     1)  `triage_mapped` drains `self.mapped`, checking the submission index
///         of each buffer against the queue submissions that have finished
///         execution. Buffers used by submissions still in flight go in
///         `self.active[index].mapped`, and the rest go into
///         `self.ready_to_map`.
///
///     2)  `triage_submissions` moves entries in `self.active[i]` for completed
///         submissions to `self.ready_to_map`.  At this point, both
///         `self.active` and `self.ready_to_map` are up to date with the given
///         submission index.
///
///     3)  `handle_mapping` drains `self.ready_to_map` and actually maps the
///         buffers, collecting a list of notification closures to call. But any
///         buffers that were dropped by the user get moved to
///         `self.free_resources`.
///
///     4)  `cleanup` frees everything in `free_resources`.

/// buffer. This new `Arc` is only dropped by `handle_mapping`.
