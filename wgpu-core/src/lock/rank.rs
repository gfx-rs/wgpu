//! Ranks for `wgpu-core` locks, restricting acquisition order.
//!
//! See [`LockRank`].

/// The rank of a lock.
///
/// Each [`Mutex`], [`RwLock`], and [`SnatchLock`] in `wgpu-core` has been
/// assigned a *rank*: a node in the DAG defined at the bottom of
/// `wgpu-core/src/lock/rank.rs`. The rank of the most recently
/// acquired lock you are still holding determines which locks you may
/// attempt to acquire next.
///
/// When you create a lock in `wgpu-core`, you must specify its rank
/// by passing in a [`LockRank`] value. This module declares a
/// pre-defined set of ranks to cover everything in `wgpu-core`, named
/// after the type in which they occur, and the name of the type's
/// field that is a lock. For example, [`CommandBuffer::data`] is a
/// `Mutex`, and its rank here is the constant
/// [`COMMAND_BUFFER_DATA`].
///
/// [`Mutex`]: parking_lot::Mutex
/// [`RwLock`]: parking_lot::RwLock
/// [`SnatchLock`]: crate::snatch::SnatchLock
/// [`CommandBuffer::data`]: crate::command::CommandBuffer::data

    /// If `rank` is the rank of the most recently acquired lock we
    /// are still holding, then `rank.followers` is the mask of
    /// locks we are allowed to acquire next.
