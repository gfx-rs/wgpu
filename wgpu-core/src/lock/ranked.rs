//! Lock types that enforce well-ranked lock acquisition order.
//!
//! This module's [`Mutex`] and [`RwLock` types are instrumented to check that
//! `wgpu-core` acquires locks according to their rank, to prevent deadlocks. To
//! use it, put `--cfg wgpu_validate_locks` in `RUSTFLAGS`.
//!
//! The [`LockRank`] constants in the [`lock::rank`] module describe edges in a
//! directed graph of lock acquisitions: each lock's rank says, if this is the most
//! recently acquired lock that you are still holding, then these are the locks you
//! are allowed to acquire next.
//!
//! As long as this graph doesn't have cycles, any number of threads can acquire
//! locks along paths through the graph without deadlock:
//!
//! - Assume that if a thread is holding a lock, then it will either release it,
//!   or block trying to acquire another one. No thread just sits on its locks
//!   forever for unrelated reasons. If it did, then that would be a source of
//!   deadlock "outside the system" that we can't do anything about.
//!
//! - This module asserts that threads acquire and release locks in a stack-like
//!   order: a lock is dropped only when it is the *most recently acquired* lock
//!   *still held* - call this the "youngest" lock. This stack-like ordering
//!   isn't a Rust requirement; Rust lets you drop guards in any order you like.
//!   This is a restriction we impose.
//!
//! - Consider the directed graph whose nodes are locks, and whose edges go from
//!   each lock to its permitted followers, the locks in its [`LockRank::followers`]
//!   set. The definition of the [`lock::rank`] module's [`LockRank`] constants
//!   ensures that this graph has no cycles, including trivial cycles from a node to
//!   itself.
//!
//! - This module then asserts that each thread attempts to acquire a lock only if
//!   it is among its youngest lock's permitted followers. Thus, as a thread
//!   acquires locks, it must be traversing a path through the graph along its
//!   edges.
//!  
//! - Because there are no cycles in the graph, whenever one thread is blocked
//!   waiting to acquire a lock, that lock must be held by a different thread: if
//!   you were allowed to acquire a lock you already hold, that would be a cycle in
//!   the graph.
//!
//! - Furthermore, because the graph has no cycles, as we work our way from each
//!   thread to the thread it is blocked waiting for, we must eventually reach an
//!   end point: there must be some thread that is able to acquire its next lock, or
//!   that is about to release a lock.
//!
//! Thus, the system as a whole is always able to make progress: it is free of
//! deadlocks.
//!
//! Note that this validation only monitors each thread's behavior in isolation:
//! there's only thread-local state, nothing communicated between threads. So we
//! don't detect deadlocks, per se, only the potential to cause deadlocks. This
//! means that the validation is conservative, but more reproducible, since it's not
//! dependent on any particular interleaving of execution.
//!
