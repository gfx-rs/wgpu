//! Lock types that observe lock acquisition order.
//!
//! This module's [`Mutex`] type is instrumented to observe the
//! nesting of `wgpu-core` lock acquisitions. Whenever `wgpu-core`
//! acquires one lock while it is already holding another, we note
//! that nesting pair. This tells us what the [`LockRank::followers`]
//! set for each lock would need to include to accommodate
//! `wgpu-core`'s observed behavior.
//!
//! When `wgpu-core`'s `observe_locks` feature is enabled, if the
//! `WGPU_CORE_LOCK_OBSERVE_DIR` environment variable is set to the
//! path of an existing directory, then every thread that acquires a
//! lock in `wgpu-core` will write its own log file to that directory.
//! You can then run the `wgpu` workspace's `lock-analyzer` binary to
//! read those files and summarize the results. The output from
//! `lock-analyzer` has the same form as the lock ranks given in
//! [`lock/rank.rs`].
//!
//! If the `WGPU_CORE_LOCK_OBSERVE_DIR` environment variable is not
//! set, then no instrumentation takes place, and the locks behave
//! normally.
//!
//! To make sure we capture all acquisitions regardless of when the
//! program exits, each thread writes events directly to its log file
//! as they occur. A `write` system call is generally just a copy from
//! userspace into the kernel's buffer, so hopefully this approach
//! will still have tolerable performance.
//!
