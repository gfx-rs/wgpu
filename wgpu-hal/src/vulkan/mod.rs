# Vulkan API internals.

## Stack memory

Ash expects slices, which we don't generally have available.
We cope with this requirement by the combination of the following ways:
  - temporarily allocating `Vec` on heap, where overhead is permitted
  - growing temporary local storage

## Framebuffers and Render passes

Render passes are cached on the device and kept forever.

Framebuffers are also cached on the device, but they are removed when
any of the image views (they have) gets removed.
If Vulkan supports image-less framebuffers,
then the actual views are excluded from the framebuffer key.

## Fences

If timeline semaphores are available, they are used 1:1 with wgpu-hal fences.
Otherwise, we manage a pool of `VkFence` objects behind each `hal::Fence`.

/// Semaphores for forcing queue submissions to run in order.
///
/// The [`wgpu_hal::Queue`] trait promises that if two calls to [`submit`] are
/// ordered, then the first submission will finish on the GPU before the second
/// submission begins. To get this behavior on Vulkan we need to pass semaphores
/// to [`vkQueueSubmit`] for the commands to wait on before beginning execution,
/// and to signal when their execution is done.
///
/// Normally this can be done with a single semaphore, waited on and then
/// signalled for each submission. At any given time there's exactly one
/// submission that would signal the semaphore, and exactly one waiting on it,
/// as Vulkan requires.
///
/// However, as of Oct 2021, bug [#5508] in the Mesa ANV drivers caused them to
/// hang if we use a single semaphore. The workaround is to alternate between
/// two semaphores. The bug has been fixed in Mesa, but we should probably keep
/// the workaround until, say, Oct 2026.
