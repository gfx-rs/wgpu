//! A cross-platform unsafe graphics abstraction.
//!
//! This crate defines a set of traits abstracting over modern graphics APIs,
//! with implementations ("backends") for Vulkan, Metal, Direct3D, and GL.
//!
//! `wgpu-hal` is a spiritual successor to
//! [gfx-hal](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx), but with reduced scope, and
//! oriented towards WebGPU implementation goals. It has no overhead for
//! validation or tracking, and the API translation overhead is kept to the bare
//! minimum by the design of WebGPU. This API can be used for resource-demanding
//! applications and engines.
//!
//! The `wgpu-hal` crate's main design choices:
//!
//! - Our traits are meant to be *portable*: proper use
//!   should get equivalent results regardless of the backend.
//!
//! - Our traits' contracts are *unsafe*: implementations perform minimal
//!   validation, if any, and incorrect use will often cause undefined behavior.
//!   This allows us to minimize the overhead we impose over the underlying
//!   graphics system. If you need safety, the [`wgpu-core`] crate provides a
//!   safe API for driving `wgpu-hal`, implementing all necessary validation,
//!   resource state tracking, and so on. (Note that `wgpu-core` is designed for
//!   use via FFI; the [`wgpu`] crate provides more idiomatic Rust bindings for
//!   `wgpu-core`.) Or, you can do your own validation.
//!
//! - In the same vein, returned errors *only cover cases the user can't
//!   anticipate*, like running out of memory or losing the device. Any errors
//!   that the user could reasonably anticipate are their responsibility to
//!   avoid. For example, `wgpu-hal` returns no error for mapping a buffer that's
//!   not mappable: as the buffer creator, the user should already know if they
//!   can map it.
//!
//! - We use *static dispatch*. The traits are not
//!   generally object-safe. You must select a specific backend type
//!   like [`vulkan::Api`] or [`metal::Api`], and then use that
//!   according to the main traits, or call backend-specific methods.
//!
//! - We use *idiomatic Rust parameter passing*,
//!   taking objects by reference, returning them by value, and so on,
//!   unlike `wgpu-core`, which refers to objects by ID.
//!
//! - We map buffer contents *persistently*. This means that the buffer can
//!   remain mapped on the CPU while the GPU reads or writes to it. You must
//!   explicitly indicate when data might need to be transferred between CPU and
//!   GPU, if [`Device::map_buffer`] indicates that this is necessary.
//!
//! - You must record *explicit barriers* between different usages of a
//!   resource. For example, if a buffer is written to by a compute
//!   shader, and then used as and index buffer to a draw call, you
//!   must use [`CommandEncoder::transition_buffers`] between those two
//!   operations.
//!
//! - Pipeline layouts are *explicitly specified* when setting bind groups.
//!   Incompatible layouts disturb groups bound at higher indices.
//!
//! - The API *accepts collections as iterators*, to avoid forcing the user to
//!   store data in particular containers. The implementation doesn't guarantee
//!   that any of the iterators are drained, unless stated otherwise by the
//!   function documentation. For this reason, we recommend that iterators don't
//!   do any mutating work.
//!
//! Unfortunately, `wgpu-hal`'s safety requirements are not fully documented.
//! Ideally, all trait methods would have doc comments setting out the
//! requirements users must meet to ensure correct and portable behavior. If you
//! are aware of a specific requirement that a backend imposes that is not
//! ensured by the traits' documented rules, please file an issue. Or, if you are
//! a capable technical writer, please file a pull request!

//!
//! ## Primary backends
//!
//! The `wgpu-hal` crate has full-featured backends implemented on the following
//! platform graphics APIs:
//!
//! - Vulkan, available on Linux, Android, and Windows, using the [`ash`] crate's
//!   Vulkan bindings. It's also available on macOS, if you install [MoltenVK].
//!
//! - Metal on macOS, using the [`metal`] crate's bindings.
//!
//! - Direct3D 12 on Windows, using the [`d3d12`] crate's bindings.
//!
//! [`ash`]: https://crates.io/crates/ash
//! [MoltenVK]: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK
//! [`metal`]: https://crates.io/crates/metal
//! [`d3d12`]: https://crates.io/crates/d3d12
//!
//! ## Secondary backends
//!
//! The `wgpu-hal` crate has a partial implementation based on the following
//! platform graphics API:
//!
//! - The GL backend is available anywhere OpenGL, OpenGL ES, or WebGL are
//!   available. See the [`gles`] module documentation for details.
//!
//! [`gles`]: gles/index.html
//!
//! You can see what capabilities an adapter is missing by checking the
//! [`DownlevelCapabilities`][tdc] in [`ExposedAdapter::capabilities`], available
//! from [`Instance::enumerate_adapters`].
//!
//! The API is generally designed to fit the primary backends better than the
//! secondary backends, so the latter may impose more overhead.
//!
//! [tdc]: wgt::DownlevelCapabilities
//!
//! ## Traits
//!
//! The `wgpu-hal` crate defines a handful of traits that together
//! represent a cross-platform abstraction for modern GPU APIs.
//!
//! - The [`Api`] trait represents a `wgpu-hal` backend. It has no methods of its
//!   own, only a collection of associated types.
//!
//! - [`Api::Instance`] implements the [`Instance`] trait. [`Instance::init`]
//!   creates an instance value, which you can use to enumerate the adapters
//!   available on the system. For example, [`vulkan::Api::Instance::init`][Ii]
//!   returns an instance that can enumerate the Vulkan physical devices on your
//!   system.
//!
//! - [`Api::Adapter`] implements the [`Adapter`] trait, representing a
//!   particular device from a particular backend. For example, a Vulkan instance
//!   might have a Lavapipe software adapter and a GPU-based adapter.
//!
//! - [`Api::Device`] implements the [`Device`] trait, representing an active
//!   link to a device. You get a device value by calling [`Adapter::open`], and
//!   then use it to create buffers, textures, shader modules, and so on.
//!
//! - [`Api::Queue`] implements the [`Queue`] trait, which you use to submit
//!   command buffers to a given device.
//!
//! - [`Api::CommandEncoder`] implements the [`CommandEncoder`] trait, which you
//!   use to build buffers of commands to submit to a queue. This has all the
//!   methods for drawing and running compute shaders, which is presumably what
//!   you're here for.
//!
//! - [`Api::Surface`] implements the [`Surface`] trait, which represents a
//!   swapchain for presenting images on the screen, via interaction with the
//!   system's window manager.
//!
//! The [`Api`] trait has various other associated types like [`Api::Buffer`] and
//! [`Api::Texture`] that represent resources the rest of the interface can
//! operate on, but these generally do not have their own traits.
//!
//! [Ii]: Instance::init
//!
//! ## Validation is the calling code's responsibility, not `wgpu-hal`'s
//!
//! As much as possible, `wgpu-hal` traits place the burden of validation,
//! resource tracking, and state tracking on the caller, not on the trait
//! implementations themselves. Anything which can reasonably be handled in
//! backend-independent code should be. A `wgpu_hal` backend's sole obligation is
//! to provide portable behavior, and report conditions that the calling code
//! can't reasonably anticipate, like device loss or running out of memory.
//!
//! The `wgpu` crate collection is intended for use in security-sensitive
//! applications, like web browsers, where the API is available to untrusted
//! code. This means that `wgpu-core`'s validation is not simply a service to
//! developers, to be provided opportunistically when the performance costs are
//! acceptable and the necessary data is ready at hand. Rather, `wgpu-core`'s
//! validation must be exhaustive, to ensure that even malicious content cannot
//! provoke and exploit undefined behavior in the platform's graphics API.
//!
//! Because graphics APIs' requirements are complex, the only practical way for
//! `wgpu` to provide exhaustive validation is to comprehensively track the
//! lifetime and state of all the resources in the system. Implementing this
//! separately for each backend is infeasible; effort would be better spent
//! making the cross-platform validation in `wgpu-core` legible and trustworthy.
//! Fortunately, the requirements are largely similar across the various
//! platforms, so cross-platform validation is practical.
//!
//! Some backends have specific requirements that aren't practical to foist off
//! on the `wgpu-hal` user. For example, properly managing macOS Objective-C or
//! Microsoft COM reference counts is best handled by using appropriate pointer
//! types within the backend.
//!
//! A desire for "defense in depth" may suggest performing additional validation
//! in `wgpu-hal` when the opportunity arises, but this must be done with
//! caution. Even experienced contributors infer the expectations their changes
//! must meet by considering not just requirements made explicit in types, tests,
//! assertions, and comments, but also those implicit in the surrounding code.
//! When one sees validation or state-tracking code in `wgpu-hal`, it is tempting
//! to conclude, "Oh, `wgpu-hal` checks for this, so `wgpu-core` needn't worry
//! about it - that would be redundant!" The responsibility for exhaustive
//! validation always rests with `wgpu-core`, regardless of what may or may not
//! be checked in `wgpu-hal`.
//!
//! To this end, any "defense in depth" validation that does appear in `wgpu-hal`
//! for requirements that `wgpu-core` should have enforced should report failure
//! via the `unreachable!` macro, because problems detected at this stage always
//! indicate a bug in `wgpu-core`.
//!
//! ## Debugging
//!
//! Most of the information on the wiki [Debugging wgpu Applications][wiki-debug]
//! page still applies to this API, with the exception of API tracing/replay
//! functionality, which is only available in `wgpu-core`.
//!
//! [wiki-debug]: https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki/Debugging-wgpu-Applications
