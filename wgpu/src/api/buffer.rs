///
/// A `Buffer`'s bytes have "interior mutability": functions like
/// [`Queue::write_buffer`] or [mapping] a buffer for writing only require a
/// `&Buffer`, not a `&mut Buffer`, even though they modify its contents. `wgpu`
/// prevents simultaneous reads and writes of buffer contents using run-time
/// checks.
///
/// [mapping]: Buffer#mapping-buffers
///
/// # Mapping buffers
///
/// If a `Buffer` is created with the appropriate [`usage`], it can be *mapped*:
/// you can make its contents accessible to the CPU as an ordinary `&[u8]` or
/// `&mut [u8]` slice of bytes. Buffers created with the
/// [`mapped_at_creation`][mac] flag set are also mapped initially.
///
/// Depending on the hardware, the buffer could be memory shared between CPU and
/// GPU, so that the CPU has direct access to the same bytes the GPU will
/// consult; or it may be ordinary CPU memory, whose contents the system must
/// copy to/from the GPU as needed. This crate's API is designed to work the
/// same way in either case: at any given time, a buffer is either mapped and
/// available to the CPU, or unmapped and ready for use by the GPU, but never
/// both. This makes it impossible for either side to observe changes by the
/// other immediately, and any necessary transfers can be carried out when the
/// buffer transitions from one state to the other.
///
/// There are two ways to map a buffer:
///
/// - If [`BufferDescriptor::mapped_at_creation`] is `true`, then the entire
///   buffer is mapped when it is created. This is the easiest way to initialize
///   a new buffer. You can set `mapped_at_creation` on any kind of buffer,
///   regardless of its [`usage`] flags.
///
/// - If the buffer's [`usage`] includes the [`MAP_READ`] or [`MAP_WRITE`]
///   flags, then you can call `buffer.slice(range).map_async(mode, callback)`
///   to map the portion of `buffer` given by `range`. This waits for the GPU to
///   finish using the buffer, and invokes `callback` as soon as the buffer is
///   safe for the CPU to access.
///
/// Once a buffer is mapped:
///
/// - You can call `buffer.slice(range).get_mapped_range()` to obtain a
///   [`BufferView`], which dereferences to a `&[u8]` that you can use to read
///   the buffer's contents.
///
/// - Or, you can call `buffer.slice(range).get_mapped_range_mut()` to obtain a
///   [`BufferViewMut`], which dereferences to a `&mut [u8]` that you can use to
///   read and write the buffer's contents.
///
/// The given `range` must fall within the mapped portion of the buffer. If you
/// attempt to access overlapping ranges, even for shared access only, these
/// methods panic.
///
/// While a buffer is mapped, you may not submit any commands to the GPU that
/// access it. You may record command buffers that use the buffer, but if you
/// submit them while the buffer is mapped, submission will panic.
///
/// When you are done using the buffer on the CPU, you must call
/// [`Buffer::unmap`] to make it available for use by the GPU again. All
/// [`BufferView`] and [`BufferViewMut`] views referring to the buffer must be
/// dropped before you unmap it; otherwise, [`Buffer::unmap`] will panic.
///
/// # Example
///
/// If `buffer` was created with [`BufferUsages::MAP_WRITE`], we could fill it
/// with `f32` values like this:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # mod bytemuck {
/// #     pub fn cast_slice_mut(bytes: &mut [u8]) -> &mut [f32] { todo!() }
/// # }
/// # let device: wgpu::Device = todo!();
/// # let buffer: wgpu::Buffer = todo!();
/// let buffer = std::sync::Arc::new(buffer);
/// let capturable = buffer.clone();
/// buffer.slice(..).map_async(wgpu::MapMode::Write, move |result| {
///     if result.is_ok() {
///         let mut view = capturable.slice(..).get_mapped_range_mut();
///         let floats: &mut [f32] = bytemuck::cast_slice_mut(&mut view);
///         floats.fill(42.0);
///         drop(view);
///         capturable.unmap();
///     }
/// });
/// ```
///
/// This code takes the following steps:
///
/// - First, it moves `buffer` into an [`Arc`], and makes a clone for capture by
///   the callback passed to [`map_async`]. Since a [`map_async`] callback may be
///   invoked from another thread, interaction between the callback and the
///   thread calling [`map_async`] generally requires some sort of shared heap
///   data like this. In real code, the [`Arc`] would probably own some larger
///   structure that itself owns `buffer`.
///
/// - Then, it calls [`Buffer::slice`] to make a [`BufferSlice`] referring to
///   the buffer's entire contents.
///
/// - Next, it calls [`BufferSlice::map_async`] to request that the bytes to
///   which the slice refers be made accessible to the CPU ("mapped"). This may
///   entail waiting for previously enqueued operations on `buffer` to finish.
///   Although [`map_async`] itself always returns immediately, it saves the
///   callback function to be invoked later.
///
/// - When some later call to [`Device::poll`] or [`Instance::poll_all`] (not
///   shown in this example) determines that the buffer is mapped and ready for
///   the CPU to use, it invokes the callback function.
///
/// - The callback function calls [`Buffer::slice`] and then
///   [`BufferSlice::get_mapped_range_mut`] to obtain a [`BufferViewMut`], which
///   dereferences to a `&mut [u8]` slice referring to the buffer's bytes.
///
/// - It then uses the [`bytemuck`] crate to turn the `&mut [u8]` into a `&mut
///   [f32]`, and calls the slice [`fill`] method to fill the buffer with a
///   useful value.
///
/// - Finally, the callback drops the view and calls [`Buffer::unmap`] to unmap
///   the buffer. In real code, the callback would also need to do some sort of
///   synchronization to let the rest of the program know that it has completed
///   its work.
///
/// If using [`map_async`] directly is awkward, you may find it more convenient to
/// use [`Queue::write_buffer`] and [`util::DownloadBuffer::read_buffer`].
/// However, those each have their own tradeoffs; the asynchronous nature of GPU
/// execution makes it hard to avoid friction altogether.

/// ## Mapping buffers on the web
///
/// When compiled to WebAssembly and running in a browser content process,
/// `wgpu` implements its API in terms of the browser's WebGPU implementation.
/// In this context, `wgpu` is further isolated from the GPU:
///
/// - Depending on the browser's WebGPU implementation, mapping and unmapping
///   buffers probably entails copies between WebAssembly linear memory and the
///   graphics driver's buffers.
///
/// - All modern web browsers isolate web content in its own sandboxed process,
///   which can only interact with the GPU via interprocess communication (IPC).
///   Although most browsers' IPC systems use shared memory for large data
///   transfers, there will still probably need to be copies into and out of the
///   shared memory buffers.
///
/// All of these copies contribute to the cost of buffer mapping in this
/// configuration.
