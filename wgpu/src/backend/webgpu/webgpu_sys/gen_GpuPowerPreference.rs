// DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
//
// This module part of a subset of web-sys that is used by wgpu's webgpu backend.
//
// These bindings are vendored into wgpu for the sole purpose of letting
// us pin the WebGPU backend to a specific version of the bindings, not
// to enable local changes. There are no provisions to preserve changes
// you make here the next time we re-vendor the bindings.
//
// The `web-sys` crate does not treat breaking changes to the WebGPU API
// as semver breaking changes, as WebGPU is "unstable". This means Cargo
// will not let us mix versions of `web-sys`, pinning WebGPU bindings to
// a specific version, while letting other bindings like WebGL get
// updated. Vendoring WebGPU was the workaround we chose.
//
// Vendoring also allows us to avoid building `web-sys` with
// `--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis`, needed to get the WebGPU bindings.
//
// If you want to improve the generated code, please submit a PR to the https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen repository.
//
// This file was generated by the `cargo xtask vendor-web-sys --version 0.2.91` command.
