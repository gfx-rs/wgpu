Collection of CPU benchmarks for `wgpu`.

These benchmarks are designed as a first line of defence against performance regressions and generally approximate the performance for users.
They all do very little GPU work and are testing the CPU performance of the API.

Criterion will give you the end-to-end performance of the benchmark, but you can also use a profiler to get more detailed information about where time is being spent.

## Usage

```sh
# Run all benchmarks
cargo bench -p wgpu-benchmark
# Run a specific benchmarks that contains "filter" in its name
cargo bench -p wgpu-benchmark -- "filter"
```

## Benchmarks

#### `Renderpass`

This benchmark measures the performance of recording and submitting a render pass with a large
number of draw calls and resources, emulating an intense, more traditional graphics application. 
By default it measures 10k draw calls, with 90k total resources.

Within this benchmark, both single threaded and multi-threaded recording are tested, as well as splitting
the render pass into multiple passes over multiple command buffers.

#### `Resource Creation`

This benchmark measures the performance of creating large resources. By default it makes buffers that are 256MB. It tests this over a range of thread counts.

#### `Shader Compilation`

This benchmark measures the performance of naga parsing, validating, and generating shaders. 

## Comparing Against a Baseline

To compare the current benchmarks against a baseline, you can use the `--save-baseline` and `--baseline` flags.

For example, to compare v0.20 against trunk, you could run the following:

```sh
git checkout v0.20

# Run the baseline benchmarks
cargo bench -p wgpu-benchmark -- --save-baseline "v0.20"

git checkout trunk

# Run the current benchmarks
cargo bench -p wgpu-benchmark -- --baseline "v0.20"
```

You can use this for any bits of code you want to compare.

## Integration with Profilers

The benchmarks can be run with a profiler to get more detailed information about where time is being spent.
Integrations are available for `tracy` and `superluminal`. Due to some implementation details,
you need to uncomment the features in the `Cargo.toml` to allow features to be used.

#### Tracy

Tracy is available prebuilt for Windows on [github](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/latest/).

```sh
# Once this is running, you can connect to it with the Tracy Profiler
cargo bench -p wgpu-benchmark --features tracy
```

#### Superluminal

Superluminal is a paid product for windows available [here](https://superluminal.eu/).

```sh
# This command will build the benchmarks, and display the path to the executable
cargo bench -p wgpu-benchmark --features superluminal -- -h

# Have Superluminal run the following command (replacing with the path to the executable)
./target/release/deps/root-2c45d61b38a65438.exe --bench "filter"
```

#### `perf` and others

You can follow the same pattern as above to run the benchmarks with other profilers.
For example, the command line tool `perf` can be used to profile the benchmarks.

```sh
# This command will build the benchmarks, and display the path to the executable
cargo bench -p wgpu-benchmark -- -h

# Run the benchmarks with perf
perf record ./target/release/deps/root-2c45d61b38a65438 --bench "filter"
```
