This is an active GitHub mirror of the WebGPU native implementation in Rust, which now lives in [Mozilla-central](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central). Issues and pull requests are accepted, but we merge them in m-c manually and then sync to GitHub instead of landing directly here.

# WebGPU
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gfx-rs/wgpu.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gfx-rs/wgpu)

This is an experimental [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/) implementation as a native static library. It's written in Rust and is based on [gfx-hal](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx) and [Rendy](https://github.com/amethyst/rendy) libraries. The corresponding WebIDL specification can be found at [gpuweb project](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/master/spec/index.bs).

The implementation consists of the following parts:
  1. `wgpu-core` - internal Rust API for WebGPU implementations to use
  2. `wgpu-native` - the native implementation of WebGPU as a C API library
  3. `wgpu-remote` - remoting layer to work with WebGPU across the process boundary
  4. `ffi` - the C headers generated by [cbindgen](https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen) for both of the libraries

## Usage

This repository contains C-language examples that link to the native library targets and perform basic rendering and computation. Please refer to our [Getting Started](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki/Getting-Started#getting-started) page at the wiki for more information.
