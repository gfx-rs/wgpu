This is an active GitHub mirror of the WebGPU implementation in Rust, which now lives in "gfx/wgpu" of [Mozilla-central](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/gfx/wgpu). Issues and pull requests are accepted, but some bidirectional synchronization may be involved.

This is an experimental [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/) implementation, exposing both Rust and C interfaces as a native static library. It's written in Rust and is based on [gfx-hal](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx) and a few [Rendy](https://github.com/amethyst/rendy) bits. See the upstream [WebGPU specification](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) (work in progress).

The implementation consists of the following parts:
  1. `wgpu-core` - internal Rust API for WebGPU implementations to use
  2. `wgpu-native` - the native implementation of WebGPU as a C API library
  3. `wgpu-remote` - remoting layer to work with WebGPU across the process boundary, as a C API library used by Gecko
  4. `ffi` - the C headers generated by [cbindgen](https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen) for the native headers

## Usage

This repository contains C-language examples that link to the native library targets and perform basic rendering and computation. Please refer to our [Getting Started](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki/Getting-Started#getting-started) page at the wiki for more information.
