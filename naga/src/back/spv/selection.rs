/*!
Generate SPIR-V conditional structures.

Builders for `if` structures with `and`s.

The types in this module track the information needed to emit SPIR-V code
for complex conditional structures, like those whose conditions involve
short-circuiting 'and' and 'or' structures. These track labels and can emit
`OpPhi` instructions to merge values produced along different paths.

This currently only supports exactly the forms Naga uses, so it doesn't
support `or` or `else`, and only supports zero or one merged values.

Naga needs to emit code roughly like this:

```ignore

    value = DEFAULT;
    if COND1 && COND2 {
        value = THEN_VALUE;
    }
    // use value

```

Assuming `ctx` and `block` are a mutable references to a [`BlockContext`]
and the current [`Block`], and `merge_type` is the SPIR-V type for the
merged value `value`, we can build SPIR-V for the code above like so:

```ignore

    let cond = Selection::start(block, merge_type);
        // ... compute `cond1` ...
    cond.if_true(ctx, cond1, DEFAULT);
        // ... compute `cond2` ...
    cond.if_true(ctx, cond2, DEFAULT);
        // ... compute THEN_VALUE
    let merged_value = cond.finish(ctx, THEN_VALUE);

```

After this, `merged_value` is either `DEFAULT` or `THEN_VALUE`, depending on
the path by which the merged block was reached.

This takes care of writing all branch instructions, including an
`OpSelectionMerge` annotation in the header block; starting new blocks and
assigning them labels; and emitting the `OpPhi` that gathers together the
right sources for the merged values, for every path through the selection
construct.

When there is no merged value to produce, you can pass `()` for `merge_type`
and the merge values. In this case no `OpPhi` instructions are produced, and
the `finish` method returns `()`.

To enforce proper nesting, a `Selection` takes ownership of the `&mut Block`
pointer for the duration of its lifetime. To obtain the block for generating
code in the selection's body, call the `Selection::block` method.
