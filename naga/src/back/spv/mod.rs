/// A SPIR-V type constructed during code generation.

///
/// -   They represent types synthesized during code generation, as explained
///     in the documentation for [`LookupType`].
///
/// -   They represent types for which SPIR-V forbids duplicate `OpType...`
///     instructions, requiring deduplication.
///
/// This is not a complete copy of [`TypeInner`]: for example, SPIR-V generation
/// never synthesizes new struct types, so `LocalType` has nothing for that.
///
/// Each `LocalType` variant should be handled identically to its analogous
/// `TypeInner` variant. You can use the [`make_local`] function to help with
/// this, by converting everything possible to a `LocalType` before inspecting
/// it.
///
/// ## `Localtype` equality and SPIR-V `OpType` uniqueness
///
/// The definition of `Eq` on `LocalType` is carefully chosen to help us follow
/// certain SPIR-V rules. SPIR-V ยง2.8 requires some classes of `OpType...`
/// instructions to be unique; for example, you can't have two `OpTypeInt 32 1`
/// instructions in the same module. All 32-bit signed integers must use the
/// same type id.
///
/// All SPIR-V types that must be unique can be represented as a `LocalType`,
/// and two `LocalType`s are always `Eq` if SPIR-V would require them to use the
/// same `OpType...` instruction. This lets us avoid duplicates by recording the
/// ids of the type instructions we've already generated in a hash table,
/// [`Writer::lookup_type`], keyed by `LocalType`.
///
/// As another example, [`LocalImageType`], stored in the `LocalType::Image`
/// variant, is designed to help us deduplicate `OpTypeImage` instructions. See
/// its documentation for details.
///
/// `LocalType` also includes variants like `Pointer` that do not need to be
/// unique - but it is harmless to avoid the duplication.
///
/// As it always must, the `Hash` implementation respects the `Eq` relation.
