//! Workarounds for platform bugs and limitations in switches and loops.
//!
//! In these docs, we use CamelCase links for Naga IR concepts, and ordinary
//! `code` formatting for HLSL or GLSL concepts.
//!
//! ## Avoiding `continue` within `switch`
//!
//! As described in <https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/4485>, the FXC HLSL
//! compiler doesn't allow `continue` statements within `switch` statements, but
//! Naga IR does. We work around this by introducing synthetic boolean local
//! variables and branches.
//!
//! Specifically:
//!
//! - We generate code for [`Continue`] statements within [`SwitchCase`]s that
//!   sets an introduced `bool` local to `true` and does a `break`, jumping to
//!   immediately after the generated `switch`.
//!
//! - When generating code for a [`Switch`] statement, we conservatively assume
//!   it might contain such a [`Continue`] statement, so:
//!
//!   - If it's the outermost such [`Switch`] within a [`Loop`], we declare the
//!     `bool` local ahead of the switch, initialized to `false`. Immediately
//!     after the `switch`, we check the local and do a `continue` if it's set.
//!
//!   - If the [`Switch`] is nested within other [`Switch`]es, then after the
//!     generated `switch`, we check the local (which we know was declared
//!     before the surrounding `switch`) and do a `break` if it's set.
//!
//!   - As an optimization, we only generate the check of the local if a
//!     [`Continue`] statement is encountered within the [`Switch`]. This may
//!     help drivers more easily identify that the `bool` is unused.
//!
//! So while we "weaken" the [`Continue`] statement by rendering it as a `break`
//! statement, we also place checks immediately at the locations to which those
//! `break` statements will jump, until we can be sure we've reached the
//! intended target of the original [`Continue`].
//!
//! In the case of nested [`Loop`] and [`Switch`] statements, there may be
//! multiple introduced `bool` locals in scope, but there's no problem knowing
//! which one to operate on. At any point, there is at most one [`Loop`]
//! statement that could be targeted by a [`Continue`] statement, so the correct
//! `bool` local to set and test is always the one introduced for the innermost
//! enclosing [`Loop`]'s outermost [`Switch`].
//!
//! # Avoiding single body `switch` statements
//!
//! As described in <https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/4514>, some language
//! front ends miscompile `switch` statements where all cases branch to the same
//! body. Our HLSL and GLSL backends render [`Switch`] statements with a single
//! [`SwitchCase`] as `do {} while(false);` loops.
//!
//! However, this rewriting introduces a new loop that could "capture"
//! `continue` statements in its body. To avoid doing so, we apply the
//! [`Continue`]-to-`break` transformation described above.
//!
//! [`Continue`]: crate::Statement::Continue
//! [`Loop`]: crate::Statement::Loop
//! [`Switch`]: crate::Statement::Switch
//! [`SwitchCase`]: crate::SwitchCase
