# Layout of values in `uniform` buffers

WGSL's ["Internal Layout of Values"][ilov] rules specify how each WGSL
type should be stored in `uniform` and `storage` buffers. The HLSL we
generate must access values in that form, even when it is not what
HLSL would use normally.

The rules described here only apply to WGSL `uniform` variables. WGSL
`storage` buffers are translated as HLSL `ByteAddressBuffers`, for
which we generate `Load` and `Store` method calls with explicit byte
offsets. WGSL pipeline inputs must be scalars or vectors; they cannot
be matrices, which is where the interesting problems arise.

## Row- and column-major ordering for matrices

WGSL specifies that matrices in uniform buffers are stored in
column-major order. This matches HLSL's default, so one might expect
things to be straightforward. Unfortunately, WGSL and HLSL disagree on
what indexing a matrix means: in WGSL, `m[i]` retrieves the `i`'th
*column* of `m`, whereas in HLSL it retrieves the `i`'th *row*. We
want to avoid translating `m[i]` into some complicated reassembly of a
vector from individually fetched components, so this is a problem.

However, with a bit of trickery, it is possible to use HLSL's `m[i]`
as the translation of WGSL's `m[i]`:

- We declare all matrices in uniform buffers in HLSL with the
  `row_major` qualifier, and transpose the row and column counts: a
  WGSL `mat3x4<f32>`, say, becomes an HLSL `row_major float3x4`. (Note
  that WGSL and HLSL type names put the row and column in reverse
  order.) Since the HLSL type is the transpose of how WebGPU directs
  the user to store the data, HLSL will load all matrices transposed.

- Since matrices are transposed, an HLSL indexing expression retrieves
  the "columns" of the intended WGSL value, as desired.

- For vector-matrix multiplication, since `mul(transpose(m), v)` is
  equivalent to `mul(v, m)` (note the reversal of the arguments), and
  `mul(v, transpose(m))` is equivalent to `mul(m, v)`, we can
  translate WGSL `m * v` and `v * m` to HLSL by simply reversing the
  arguments to `mul`.

## Padding in two-row matrices

An HLSL `row_major floatKx2` matrix has padding between its rows that
the WGSL `matKx2<f32>` matrix it represents does not. HLSL stores all
matrix rows [aligned on 16-byte boundaries][16bb], whereas WGSL says
that the columns of a `matKx2<f32>` need only be [aligned as required
for `vec2<f32>`][ilov], which is [eight-byte alignment][8bb].

To compensate for this, any time a `matKx2<f32>` appears in a WGSL
`uniform` variable, whether directly as the variable's type or as part
of a struct/array, we actually emit `K` separate `float2` members, and
assemble/disassemble the matrix from its columns (in WGSL; rows in
HLSL) upon load and store.

For example, the following WGSL struct type:

```ignore
struct Baz {
        m: mat3x2<f32>,
}
```

is rendered as the HLSL struct type:

```ignore
struct Baz {
    float2 m_0; float2 m_1; float2 m_2;
};
```

The `wrapped_struct_matrix` functions in `help.rs` generate HLSL
helper functions to access such members, converting between the stored
form and the HLSL matrix types appropriately. For example, for reading
the member `m` of the `Baz` struct above, we emit:

```ignore
float3x2 GetMatmOnBaz(Baz obj) {
    return float3x2(obj.m_0, obj.m_1, obj.m_2);
}
```

We also emit an analogous `Set` function, as well as functions for
accessing individual columns by dynamic index.
