/// A front end can use a `Typifier` to get types for an arena's expressions
/// while it is still contributing expressions to it. At any point, you can call
/// [`typifier.grow(expr, arena, ctx)`], where `expr` is a `Handle<Expression>`
/// referring to something in `arena`, and the `Typifier` will resolve the types
/// of all the expressions up to and including `expr`. Then you can write
/// `typifier[handle]` to get the type of any handle at or before `expr`.
///
/// Note that `Typifier` does *not* build an `Arena<Type>` as a part of its
/// usual operation. Ideally, a module's type arena should only contain types
/// actually needed by `Handle<Type>`s elsewhere in the module — functions,
/// variables, [`Compose`] expressions, other types, and so on — so we don't
/// want every little thing that occurs as the type of some intermediate
/// expression to show up there.
///
/// Instead, `Typifier` accumulates a [`TypeResolution`] for each expression,
/// which refers to the `Arena<Type>` in the [`ResolveContext`] passed to `grow`
/// as needed. [`TypeResolution`] is a lightweight representation for
/// intermediate types like this; see its documentation for details.
///
/// If you do need to register a `Typifier`'s conclusion in an `Arena<Type>`
/// (say, for a [`LocalVariable`] whose type you've inferred), you can use
/// [`register_type`] to do so.
