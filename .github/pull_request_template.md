<!--
Non-trivial functional changes would need to be tested through:
  - [wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) - test the examples.
  - [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/) - check the generated C header for sanity.

Ideally, a PR needs to link to the draft PRs in these projects with relevant modifications.
See https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/666 for an example.
If you can add a unit/integration test here in `wgpu`, that would be best.
