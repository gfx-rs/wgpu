# Even if you aren't actually building `wgpu-info`,
# enabling the `angle` and `vulkan-portability` features of wgpu enables them for everything built in this workspace.
# This includes the web examples, which fail to compile when Vulkan is enabled,
# so disable that on web (by just disabling everything, since this won't compile for wasm anyway).
