# Jujutsu
#
# When using the WGPU repository through [Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj), `.jj/` dirs.
# are ignored because Jujutsu writes a `.jj/.gitignore` file containing `/*`. Some tools, like
# `prettier`, don't handle nested `.gitgnore` properly, but they _do_ handle top-level `.gitignore`
# patterns properly. So, include it here, even though we shouldn't need it. :cry:
